States exist to manage problems of human coordination at scale. Human communities are
capable of extraordinary achievements, both in terms of improving their own welfare and
accomplishing external goals. But their ability to realize those capabilities, to actually
achieve depends upon the scale of those communities and their ability to specialize and
coordinate in the service of communal ends.

Many of those ends will be contested and contestable. 
But every human community must meet prerequisites for survival. Food must be produced and distributed. 
Armies must be raised, if only for defense.
Liberalism sometimes pretends to abjure communal ends entirely, but only superficially.
A conceit that individuals should enjoy a
broad sphere of autonomy and personal choice is an additional end layered on top of communal ends that are
not in fact discretionary.

Scale begets scale in human communities. Once one community effectively organizes at scale, all
others must do the same, or at least ally themselves with communities that have done so,
in order to defend themselves. States enable scale, scale demands states, states at scale
become effectively universal. But the _character_ of states (at least thus far!) can
be quite diverse while still meeting the prerequisites of survival.

I want to highlight three mechanisms that states use to coordinate at scale: coercion,
religion, and seduction. States compel individuals to perform social roles by threatening
to withhold essential goods like food or housing if they do not, or by threatening outright
violence. States encourage members of the communities they superintend to develop beliefs
and loyalties under which they perform the roles the state prescribes because they have been persuaded
it is "right" for the community, even if it would not be their individual, personal preference.

Finally, states seduce. They offer individuals genuine choice, under circumstances where
they can afford to accept or refuse, mostly without patriotic cant or guilt trips about what is
best for the community. But they create a context where some
mix of culture and incentives ensures that a sufficient fraction of the community will
choose to perform the roles that the state requires.

In contradiction to the worn clic&eacute;s of contemporary discourse, the state for our purposes
does not stand in opposition to but includes "the market".

We define the state functionally.
The state is not a constellation of formal institutions, distinguished from a "private sector"
by organizational form. The state is the set of institutions that emerge, whatever their form,
in order to coordinate human behavior of the "nation", a community that the state constucts
at whatever scale it superintends, despite any prior affiliations or identities or ethnicities
that may have existed or still exist within that community. Whatever is typically systematic in
its effects is the state. Most market actors, individually, are idiosyncratic, not the state. But
"the market", the set of institutions that structures how and on what terms market actors transact,
the price vector that emerges from market activity, all of that is of the state for sure. And
certain kinds of formally "private" market actors &mdash; banking systems, pervasive broadcast television networks,
more recently pervasive social networks &mdash; belong to the state, because their choices plainly
have systematic rather than idiosyncratic effects. Obviously there is some dissonance between this
definition of state and more conventional definitions which might bound state-ness by legal form.
But you cannot accurately characterize how different nations effectively (or pathologically)
coordinate at scale if you omit institutions like "the market" and key "private" institutions that
structure it from your analysis. Perhaps ironically, states themselves engender this analytical error
as part of their coordinative strategy: They segregate certain means by which they implement
coordination into "private" entities as a means of rendering the coordination durable, by virtue
of removing key elements of social coordination from political contestation that may attend the
notional, legalistically defined state.

One solution we have already seen to problems of social coordination at scale is
[fascism](https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html).
Fascism emphasizes a mix of religious and overtly coercive means of control in order to
coordinate public behavior. The religion &mdash; simultaneously apocalyptic and romantic, given urgency by
devils conjured everywhere among us &mdash; reduces the need for coercion, as "patriots"
work righteously to comply _sua sponte_, but also justifies and renders tolerable the coercion.
Fascism relies least upon seduction. Fascism does not construct a sphere for autonomous citizens,
legitimately making choices to their own preferred ends, but emphasizes citizens' roles as subjects
of a greater whole to which they owe obedience.

Liberal societies, on the other hand, put choice at the center of their religion.
"[We hold these truths](https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/) to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal, that
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." There it is, stated as plainly, and
as religiously, as you could hope.

But in practice, despite the religion, liberal states often operate with a great deal of coercion.
The trick is to define their most pervasive coordinator of human behavior, "the market",
as a fact of nature rather than a constructed institution of social coordination. Most obviously,
in 1776 it was not, formally, the state that enslaved, but private individuals performing the role of owners
of chattel property. Chattel slavery is so oppressive that the trick never fully worked. However private,
slavery even then was the "peculiar institution" for a liberal society, and it frequently escaped
the artificial privateness constructed to protect it into public controversy. But the trick of
laundering coercion through the notional privateness of markets persists today. It is not seduction,
but coercion, when failing to perform the role of worker means that food and shelter will be withheld.

This is taxonomy, not a moral claim. _All_ states make use to varying degrees of religion, coercion,
and seducton to implement coordination at scale. There is no such thing as a morally innocent
state. It may be perfectly legitimate that states coerce labor. If large groups can opt out of
work, yet in the name of noncoercion food and shelter are provided them, that implies
a large burden of provision on the citizens who do not opt out. The perceived unfairness of this
may either render impossible effective
coordination at scale, as everyone withdraws from labor, or else require extraordinary
coercion of some unlucky subgroup that will be forced to provide. A kind of universal coercion
may be morally desirable, if the alternatives are social collapse or targeted oppression.

However, as human beings subject to coordination by states, we might prefer, if possible, a state
that relies as much as possible on seduction rather than coercion.
Remember, to qualify as seduction, the choices facing individuals
must be genuine. People with different preferences must actually and not rarely choose differently.
"Your money or your life" is notionally a choice, but it is actually just coercion.

States have
nonnegotiable imperatives. Someone must bake the bread. Someone must teach the children. But the state
need not have a strong interest in exactly _who_ bakes the bread or does the teaching. No one must be
forced to bake bread or teach children if, when the public is given a range of choices, enough people
opt into baking and teaching to meet the state's requirements.

There is no law of nature, no "natural"
set of property rights, that guarantees a "market" will simultaneously offer individuals real
choices, under which they can afford multiple options, _and_ meet the requirements of the state for
effective coordination at scale. Indeed, the collapse of legitimacy that now afflicts liberalism
results from the pretense that naturalized markets should inherently deliver "freedom" when in fact the choice
set delivered is quite coercive. Our religion is liberal, but we experience unfreedom. Our society's
discontents know that much, and are not wrong, even when they misidentify the sources of the unfreedom.
But the structure of our markets is malleable. How any hours must a work week be? What credential is
required to expand ones menu of choices? States can offer benefits on the side that render the choice set
people face in markets less coercive. You can choose to quit your job if you have a basic income independent
of your labor. Our religion is malleable as well. We can emphasize solidarity and the joys of participation,
rather than conceive of work as payment for leisure, and try to structure work in ways that reinforce
that. To the degree a religion like that takes root (who knows?!), people with



(which, remember,
includes the market it disowns)
