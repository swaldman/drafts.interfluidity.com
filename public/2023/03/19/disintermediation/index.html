   <p>Whenever there is a conversation about <a href="https://www.econlib.org/lyn-alden-on-bank-safety/">narrow banks</a> or <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8876.html">central bank digital currencies</a>, the bogeyman of "disintermediation" ghoulishly appears, shrieking and wailing about the death and destruction that awaits if any part of our deposits and payments system were to be wrested from the cuddly, gentle banks who grant us convenience and prosperity and take nothing from us but our ingratitude.</p>
   <p>I actively favor disintermediation of <em>status quo</em> banks. I consider the "risk" that, if the public were offered a simple, safe alternative, depositors would flee to it, to be like the risk that a better world might in fact be possible. That would mean something might change!</p>
   <p>Let's understand the issue. Currently, we hold our liquid wealth as "deposits" at commercial banks. Deposits are just loans that <em>we</em> make to banks, but they are callable on demand: we can withdraw them as cash, or use them any time to make payments. Most deposits are in fact created from loans by our banks. The name "deposit" is intentionally misleading, emphasizing the case where you "deposit" hard government cash into the bank, and that's why it owes you something back. In reality deposits are IOUs banks conjure at will, as easily as incrementing numbers in an internal database. Banks are constrained in theory in the amount of "money" they produce by the risk that account-holders may demand cash, or make payments to (net of receipts from) customers of other banks, beyond what the bank has on-hand or can borrow. Banks are constrained in practice by restrictions imposed by regulators, because it turns out the theory doesn't work. As long as customers value bank deposits at par — you accept $1 in the bank as worth the same as a green bill in your pocket — bankers would do best making up as much money as they can to invest, selling or borrowing against their investments to raise cash if customers make unexpected demands, walking away from the wreckage with profits they've already taken when they can no longer sell or borrow to meet withdrawals. If you want banks to be truly regulated by a free-market, then you'll have a shitty payments system, because a dollar "on deposit" at each bank will have to be worth less than a dollar, to account for the risk the bank's bets won't actually cover the deposits they owe. Each bank's deposits will have its own constantly changing price, whose fairness most customers will be unable to independently evaluate. If you want banks to run a smooth payments system where a dollar is a dollar at any bank, then you'll need a state, both to offer guarantees that keep the promised value credible, and then to regulate, in order to counter the "heads I win, tails I walk away" incentive that the ability to issue par-valued money begets.</p>
   <p>Seems like a lot! Why not just have some institution — a "narrow bank" if private, the central bank if public — actually just keep green money that we deposit, and we can make payments with that? A dollar would always be worth a dollar, because without any need for regulation or concern about tricky incentives. A narrow bank would basically just keep every dollar deposited to it, the Fed can issue dollars at will, when it issues back dollars previously deposited it's not increasing the quantity or liquidity of money, so there's no new inflation risk. This would be "disintermediation". We'd disintermediate the banks, finally tell them to fuck off. Hooray!</p>
   <p>But there is a real problem with disintermediation. All of the money banks conjure from thin air to make risky loans, the money regulators are endlessly struggling to prevent turning into a heads-I-win-tails-I-walk scam? That is the same money that is loaned to you when you get a mortgage to buy your home. It's the same money that finances the loan a business takes to buy its machinery or inventory or create that amazing ambiance for your dining pleasure. Those are the banks' risky bets! (Well, they are some of the banks' risky bets. Banks make a lot of less sympathetic, not-so-obviously-productive bets too.)</p>
   <p>If we <em>only</em> disintermediate, without replacing banks' phrenetic incentive to exploit their money-making franchise and invest in stuff, we'll get a lot less aggregate investment. Our civilization will collapse into <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2669.html">goat-herding</a>. The scare-mongers will have been proven correct.</p>
   <p>If we disintermediate (and goat-herding does not appeal), what could replace <em>status quo</em> banks? Do we need to invent something untried and revolutionary?</p>
   <p>Well, no. It turns out, much of our banking system is undergoing disintermediation as we speak! A week ago, the Federal Reserve announced the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm">Bank Term Funding Program</a>, which will allow</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions [to borrow] pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral...valued at par.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I know, dear reader. Finance-speak! The eyes glaze! What does all this mean, in English?</p>
   <p>It means that the general public, which usually makes the bankers' money machine work by treating bank deposits like money-good-as-cash and letting them sit unwithdrawn, is now withdrawing much of its money. If Jane Public is not deserting the banking system entirely for actual cash, then she is piling into one of <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@interfluidity/110002159996385364">Citi, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, or Wells Fargo</a>, "systematically important financual institutions" that we all know are too vast and entrenched for the government to allow depositors to be screwed. These are as risk-free good-for-the-money as the government is risk-free-good-for-the-money, because in a pinch the government would rather cover their deposits than deal with the hell that would break loose if they didn't.</p>
   <p>The big banks are <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bank-of-america-deposits-svb-too-big-to-fail-jpmorgan-2023-3">raking it in</a>! But what about the rest of the banks? They will not, you will notice, collapsing like mayflies at the end of a long summer's day. Banks' money-making machinery, and so their investment-making machinery, depends on customers' willingness to leave "their money" in the form of the deposits banks invent, rather than immediaately withdrawing it. The money small and midsized banks invented would be suddenly uninvented, and all those banks' loans and investments would have to be called or sold in a fire sale, if depositors fled and no one else could be persuaded to accept IOUs from these banks as good money. So, the Federal Reserve has stepped in and is replacing fleeing depositors, importantly without even asking whether the investments the banks have made are good enough to eventually cover the loan the government, instead of the general public, is now making to these banks. That's what "valued at par" means in finance-speak.</p>
   <p>The Federal government may lend banks a great deal under its new program, or it may ultimately lend very little. Knowing that the Fed will replace fleeing deposits with loans of goverment-issued cash, dollar-for-dollar even against bank investments that have lost value, means there is little reason for depositors to actually flee. Anytime they want to withdraw, the government will be there with a dollar for the bank to give them.</p>
   <p>There is nothing new in any of this. It is the essence of modern banking. If you want a dollar in a bank to be worth as much as a dollar in your pocket, the government must, and only the governnment can (because only it can issue dollars in any quantity, at will), be willing to replace a bank deposit with a dollar. If deposit insurance were truly limited, all but the smallest businesses would not have a reliable payments system. Since the mid-20th-Century, we've maintained the conceit that bank deposits represent private "investments" and deposit insurance is "limited" (though you can multiply it through the economically counterproductive busywork of splitting accounts). But that has been bullshit all along, because we have wanted an economy in which businesses could use the payments system as a payments system without worrying about their "investment" in the bank. The term "too big to fail" is not some new invention from the 2008 financial crisis. In the United States, it <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2017/ec-201717-origins-of-too-big-to-fail">begins in the 1970s</a>, as the strict prudential regulation enacted during the Great Depression begins to get whittled away by bankers pushing to make their money-printing machine whirr just a little bit faster. Limited deposit insurance has only ever been a thing for small banks, where it could be symbolically upheld to promote a useful myth. It has been untenable since the scale of payments by a large fraction of businesses came to exceed the level that insured accounts could conveniently provide. Big business simply banks with Citi and JP Morgan to be sure their deposit insurance is unlimited. They don't fuck around with hundreds of $250K accounts.</p>
   <p>Disintermediation is not a novelty. <em>Intermediation</em> is a fiction. The clear-eyed way to describe our banking system is that</p>
   <p>But for our purposes here, we can stick to the intentionally misleading simple case. You deposit money in the bank, the bank increments its database of how much it owes you,</p>
   <p>Another way to put that is to say that deposits are IOUs from our banks to us, but they promise to redeem them for government cash whenever they want.</p>
   <p>The IOU frame is helpful, because it reminds us that banks can <em>create</em> deposits at will. The name "deposit" is intentionally misleading. It suggests you "deposit" something into the bank, then it owes you that thing back on demand. But most deposits are never "deposited" at all: they are conjured into existence by loans. If you go to your bank and ask for a $1000 loan (and you being you, so fucking awesome, are obviously good for it), what happens is you sign a piece of paper that promises to repay the bank on certain terms, including an interest rate, and the bank just increases the number in its database that represents your account balance. The paper you sign means you owe the bank some money. The extra balance in the account means the bank owed you some money. It's a like-for-like exchange, and no government money was involved. You and the bank both just conjured up some IOUs.</p>
   <p>Suppose you use your new "cash" to buy something cool from the store. If the store and you have the same bank, guess what happens? You "spend" $500. The bank deducts $500 from your account (a record of how much the bank owes you) and add $500 to the store's account (how much the bank owes the store). No government money ever changes hands. Your bank created the "money", you and the store transact in it.</p>
   <p>Banks can't just create money however they feel like it, though. They are constrained in theory by the fact that you might want to withdraw the cash, or you might try to pay someone who banks at a different bank. In either of those cases, your bank might have to come up with government-issued money. They face two constraints, liquidity and solvency. Liquidity means they should have enough cash on hand to meet the demands of withdrawers, and of payments out to other banks, net of payments the bank receives. In any given day — well, on almost any given day — the vast majority of bank deposits will be neither withdrawn or paid out. So the bank needs to hold as <em>assets</em> (remember deposits are the bank's liabilities, its <em>debt</em>) only a little bit of government cash, whether the green paper you might withdraw from a teller or the electronic reserves used for interbank payments. The rest of the bank's deposits represent <em>loans the bank has made that it is earning interest on</em>. The bank may pay some interest on our deposits, sure, but because we value the convenience, liquidity-on-demand, and safety-from-armed-robbery that keeping our money in the bank provides, in fact we accept a much lower rate of interest than we would on some loan we made as an "investment". And that is the heart of the trick. Bank intermediation creates a pool of money bankers can invest paying much less than the interest that other investors would require for a loan to a risky investment fund. Which is precisely what a bank is.</p>
   <p>Keeping money in a bank might be convenient and keep you safe from armed robbery, but it doesn't keep you safe from a bank failure! Since the bank keeps on-hand as cash only a small fraction of hypothetically withdrawable deposits, even a bank that has invested well may sometimes face a situation where it has made promises that it cannot immediately keep. In theory, if the bank has invested well, that should be no big deal. The bank can just sell its investments (its loans to you and me!) to some other bank or investor, and those investments will be worth substantially more than all the deposits the bank owes customers, so just give them a minute or two and they'll raise the cash to pay you back (or borrow it using their sterling investments as security).</p>
   <p>However, in real life, sometimes banks will have not invested well. (Silicon Valley Bank made some <em>oopsie!</em> bets on interest rates.)</p>
