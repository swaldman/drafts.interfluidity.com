   <p>An apology for the <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-enabling-act">Enabling Act</a> that the Supreme Court has <a href="2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">judicially inserted into American law</a> goes like this:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>By prosecuting a former President, Democrats opened a Pandora's Box under which every ex-President would be prosecuted by their rivals upon retirement, crippling the office, and discouraging high-quality candidates from seeking it. The Supreme Court had to prevent this.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Let's say this was your honest concern, and you are John Roberts.</p>
   <p>You are not trying to render the Executive unaccountable. You want accountability, but some form of accountability that would deter routine political show trials of the highest-profile figure by the opposing party.</p>
   <p>That might be a reasonable thing to try to do!</p>
   <p>But if this was your motivation, the decision you would craft would look nothing like <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>.</p>
   <p>Sure, you might grant a pretty broad immunity to the President, as this decision does.</p>
   <p>But you would not grant impenetrable deference to the President's pardon power. You would <em>encourage</em>, rather than foreclose, judicial inquiry into the motivation for pardons. Pardons for crimes ordered or encouraged or intended to serve the interest of the President would be invalid.</p>
   <p>The President would be immune. His <em>subordinates</em>, however, would not be. <em>His suboordinates</em> would still have reason to refuse unlawful orders. At the very least, they would demand legal cover before following deeply questionable orders (like <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/2014-06-23_barron-memorandum.pdf">Obama got</a> before icing a US citizen in a drone strike).</p>
   <p>This is the accountabilty equilibrium we created after the Nixon Administration. Yes, Ford pardoned Nixon. Nixon got to live the rest if his days as an <em>eminence grise</em> and a free man.</p>
   <p>But many of his subordinates were imprisoned — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Haldeman">H. R. Haldeman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman">John Ehrlichman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Colson">Charles Colson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_N._Mitchell">John Mitchell</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Gordon_Liddy">G. Gordon Liddy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._McCord_Jr.">James W. McCord Jr.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dean">John Dean</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Chapin">Dwight Chapin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_W._Kalmbach">Herbert Kalmbach</a>.</p>
   <p>Had <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> been the law in 1972, all of these men could have been peremptorily pardoned. No judicial inquiry could have been made into the motivations for those pardons. No criminal liability could attach to the President for making them. No subpeonas could penetrate a hermetic wall of silence, since any contempt charges could be pardoned as well.</p>
   <p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> doesn't just grant the President immunity. It takes the heavily litigated notion of "executive privilege", renders it unjudiciable, extends it as far and wide as the President wishes to extend it, with no remedy, no consideration of other interests, no hope of ever piercing it.</p>
   <p>In its own words, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> is about encouraging "bold", "unhesitating", "energetic", "vigorous" action by the President. John Roberts could have sought to balance the public's interest in an effective Executive with the public's interest that the President "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed". He could have whispered into the Constitution the post-Richard-Nixon balance. He chose not to.</p>
   <p>John Roberts and his henchmen are very familiar with this history. What they chose to whisper into the Constitution was a <em>remedy</em> for the accountability that the Nixon administration faced. They chose quite deliberately not merely to immunize the President, but to create an unaccountable Executive, whose breadth is as wide and encompassing as the President chooses by exercise of his power to pardon.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>The United States is no longer a liberal democracy.</p>
   <p>As of Monday, July 1st, 2024 and the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>, the United States fails liberal democracy's most basic test. Citizens no longer have rights against the state that cannot be abrogated without due process, because presidential prerogatives are granted priority above due process and rendered immune from challenge by the courts.</p>
   <p>The Supreme Court has legislated a loophole through the constraints on presidential power that is so large, so conveniently and readily accessible, that all notional limits to government power can be circumvented by a determined President, with almost no risk of being held accountable.</p>
   <p>In a nutshell, the decision claims that the President has "conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority" over "commanding the Armed Forces of the United States" and "pardons for offenses against the United States".</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>A President, the decision pretends, remains accountable for "unofficial acts". For "official acts" beyond his "conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority", the President enjoys "at least a presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility."</p>
   <p>In theory, this "presumptive immunity" can be rebutted, overcome, but</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such a “highly intrusive” inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose... Nor may courts deem an action unofficial merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>This decision is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-says-the-presidents-power-will-not-be-questioned/2017/02/13/0f772184-f14f-11e6-9fb1-2d8f3fc9c0ed_video.html">Stephen Miller</a>, translated into legalese:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Our opponents, the media, and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions that the powers of the President... are very substantial and will not be questioned. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Commanding the armed forces plus the pardon power, if unaccountable and unreviewable, are sufficient to impose dictatorship.</p>
   <p>"Can't you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something?", Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1097517470/trump-esper-book-defense-secretary">asked</a> of General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley, when protesters gathered at the White House following the killing of George Floyd.</p>
   <p>Their answer, of course, was no. If Trump had ordered them to do so, it would have been an unlawful order, and they would have refused. If he insisted, he would have risked imprisonment. If they had acted, so would they.</p>
   <p>Today, if a President orders the armed forces to shoot at protesters, it would still be an unlawful order. But Trump would enjoy absolute, unreviewable, immunity for giving it.</p>
   <p>It would still be unlawful for his subordinates to act upon the order. But Trump could promise to pardon subordinates who act. He could fire subordinates who refuse.</p>
   <p>Obviously, this would be, should be, illegitimate. A President is required by the Constitution to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" as much as he is empowered as Commander-in-Chief. But on Monday, the Supreme Court plainly and explicitly placed the latter before the former.</p>
   <p>Shooting a bunch of protesters "in the legs" is small potatoes. Anything the armed forces of the United States might conceivably do the President can order. Any legal restraints that might bind his subordinates, the President can pardon. Conscientious resistors can be fired, detained, made to go through some things.</p>
   <p>Even if the Federal government cannot, might not states prosecute generals and soldiers who injure, kidnap, or kill? The President's pardon power does not reach state law.</p>
   <p>This strikes me as a pretty thin read on which to place ones hopes. Good luck enforcing arrest warrants against members of the US military for following the President's orders. Good luck preventing the President from having the armed forces detain any prosecutors or judges determined to produce them.</p>
   <p>From Sonia Sotomayor's dissenting opinion:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Obviously, it is more essential now than it was a week ago that we not elect Donald Trump to a second term. But the identity of the President is not the problem here. Here's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling/">Joe Biden</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>You know, at the outset of our nation, it was the character of George Washington, our first president, that defined the presidency. He believed power was limited, not absolute, and that power would always reside with the people — always.</p>
    <p>Now, over 200 years later, with today’s Supreme Court decision, once again it will depend on the character of the men and women who hold that presidency that are going to define the limits of the power of the presidency, because the law will no longer do it.</p>
    <p>I know I will respect the limits of the presidential power, as I have for three and a half years. But any president, including Donald Trump, will now be free to ignore the law.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>It's not about Donald Trump. United States Presidents are usually not of great character. It takes tremendous ambition, and a certain degree of sociopathy, to win a prize as coveted and valuable as that office. Every President must be willing to do things that the less sociopathic among us would struggle to live with. Even just and necessary military action imposes misery and death on people who do not deserve it, who bear no fault.</p>
   <p>Donald Trump is bad. Barack Obama repudiated prohibitions against assassination that were table stakes for the "good guys" when I grew up, and simply <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2255.html">normalized the practice</a>. At least Obama was sufficiently chastened by risks of accountability that he had the Office of Legal Counsel <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/2014-06-23_barron-memorandum.pdf">perform a thorough analysis</a> before he assassinated a US citizen. (They said it was okay.) Joe Biden has to his great credit <a href="https://theweek.com/foreign-policy/1007579/biden-nearly-ended-the-drone-war-and-nobody-noticed">largely ceased</a> America's drone assassination programs.</p>
   <p>Should we have trusted the character of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to protect our rights? The character of Bill Clinton? Richard Nixon? A rights regime that depends upon the character of the President is not a rights regime at all. Whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else, the ring of power that the Supreme Court has forged will do its work of tempting tyranny and atrocity. There are always crises, and in crises, anything seems justified. The scandal becomes failing to exploit the tools you have at hand.</p>
   <p>If the United States is to be a liberal democracy, this (legally <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-v-united-states-opinion-chief-roberts/678877/">shoddy</a>) decision must be reversed. Since the majority at the Supreme Court claims their coup is embedded in the Constitution itself, Congress is helpless to directly reverse it.</p>
   <p>John Roberts has always presented himself as an institutionalist. He is not an institutionalist. On Monday, John Roberts did far more damage to America's instituions than Donald Trump did on January 6.</p>
   <p>In the post <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> era — a decision we must now also revisit — only the Supreme Court can undo the work that it does when it speaks <em>ex cathedra</em> for the Constitution itself.</p>
   <p>I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7964.html">have been an advocate</a> for Supreme Court reform that strives not to be overtly political. I've sought procedures that would prevent factional misuse of the Court, rather than advance my own faction's views. Rather than expand or "pack" the Court, I have argued we should "merge the Court", to have its work be done by the full Federal apellate bench, with panels that hear individual cases chosen by lot. I still think that's a good approach.</p>
   <p>But this Court has created a crisis. The scandal becomes failing to exploit the tools you have at hand. It is to Joe Biden's deep discredit that, when pressed for Supreme Court reform, he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/pcscotus/">commissioned a study</a> and then did nothing with it.</p>
   <p>We are in a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/is-this-the-wile-e-coyote-moment/">Wile-E-Coyote moment</a>. The cliff has gone out from beneath our feet, but we have not yet fallen. The awful powers latent in the Supreme Court's decision have not yet been abused to crush democracy, but inevitably, inevitably, they will, if they remain as this Supreme Court has defined them.</p>
   <p>If the possibility is not permanently foreclosed on November 5, if by the grace of God alone we get another shot, we need to pack the court ASAP, and then generate a test case under which this calamity of a decision will be overturned. Normalizing court-packing is not great, but it's the only check the other branches currently have when the Supreme Court consitutionalizes atrocity.</p>
   <p>Once this awful decision has been relegated to history, I hope that we do restructure the Court to make it structurally less susceptible to serving as a tool for factional mischief. I hope that we do revisit — and temper rather than eliminate — <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>.</p>
   <p>But that is all for the future. The Supreme Court set the world aflame on Monday. If you haven't noticed the heat, if you don't notice the blisters already forming on your skin very soon, then we are all going to burn.</p>

   <p>Perhaps Joe Biden is determined, for the best reasons or the worst, to be the Democratic Party's candidate for President, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/biden-election-debate-trump.html">despite</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/opinion/biden-trump-debate-danger.html">misgivings</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/biden-democrats-debate.html">engendered</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/joe-biden-tom-friedman.html">by</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/presidential-debate-trump-biden-2024.html">his</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/opinion/joe-biden-drop-out.html">recent</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/25/opinion/thepoint?smid=url-share#krugman-biden-must-withdraw">debate</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357876/biden-trump-debate-cnn-won-step-down-atlanta">performance</a>. If that is the case, Joe Biden will be the Democratic Party's candidate for President. He won the Democratic Party's primary election.</p>
   <p>Perhaps Joe Biden is not so determined to be the Democratic Party's candidate for President. If that is the case, you may never, ever know it.</p>
   <p>As old and stumbling as Joe Biden may have appeared on the debate stage, the Biden <em>Administration</em> has comported itself with tremendous intelligence. Should it entertain a change of leadership, let's imagine that it will do so with the same intelligence. What would that look like?</p>
   <p>First, over the next few weeks, expect any possibility of a change of leadership to be mocked, rejected, completely ruled out, in every public communication. This weekend's mini rebellion among pundits and Democratic Party has-beens will be crushed. Joe Biden may be too old, he may not be the candidate we'd want to save democracy itself, but he will be the only candidate we have.</p>
   <p>All of us who do not want a second Trump administration will fall back into line. He has, in fact, been the best domestic policy President since Lyndon Johnson. Compare him to the alternative, not the almighty, we will say. It is not the doddering old man we are electing, but the remarkable administration that has somehow conjured itself around him.</p>
   <p>It won't be an easy sell to politically detached swing voters, who <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">decide</a> US Presidential elections. A personal or symbolic connection to an imagined heroic leader may be more accessible to those voters than arcana like this adminstration's remarkable <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/lina-m-khan">FTC</a>, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/bidens-nlrb-restoring-rights/">NLRB</a>, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/10/getting-things-done/#deliverism">CFPB</a>, or its <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan">SAVE plan</a>. Nevertheless the excellence of the administration's accomplishments will have the benefit of being true, and it will be all we have.</p>
   <p>Why, if Biden is considering withdrawing, will his administration completely rule out the possibility of withdrawing? Because if there is continued, credible, will-he-won't-he chatter, that will weaken him and render his continued candidacy less tenable. And in order to successfully withdraw, he must withdraw from a position of strength rather than weakness within the Democratic Party firmament. Any succession must be a negotiated succession, and Joe Biden is his own <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/what-is-batna/">BATNA</a>.</p>
   <p>As the Biden Administration quietly discusses a potential replacement ticket, ambitious strivers will try to preen and threaten their way onto it. It must always be credible for the administration just to walk away and stick with Plan A. Disappointed shadow candidates may be tempted to appeal to the public, via their duly elected representatives on the opinion pages of <em>The New York Times</em>. The administration must make clear that its response to such perfidy would be to shut the whole thing down and double-down on Joe Biden's status as the default and inevitable Democratic nominee for President.</p>
   <p>The stupidest idea widely mooted is for an "open convention". Obviously, pundits love the idea. We can have a dramatic, fast-paced horserace to supplant this current one, which smells like mothballs and stale poop. But just because a game show is good television does not mean it is a good way to choose a nominee.</p>
   <p>An "open convention" would have no meaningful democratic legitimacy. No one actually voted for the delegates who will appear at the Democratic Party convention. Democrats voted for whoever was pledged to Joe Biden. Which particular humans show up on the convention floor is determined by processes that are not meaningfully democratic. Those processes may seem "random", but they are not, they have all kinds of systematic biases towards certain kinds of enthusiasts and operatives not remotely representative of Democratic Party rank-and-file. Choice by convention delegates is not some defensible sort of <a href="https://equalitybylot.com/introduction-to-sortition-government-by-jury/">sortition</a> by the back door.</p>
   <p>The only person with any democratic mandate to choose a successor to Joe Biden as Democratic Party nominee is Joe Biden himself, who won a Democratic Party primary open to the public at-large.</p>
   <p>Putting aside endlessly contestable arguments about legitimacy, the whole point of switching horses is risk management. The only reason Joe Biden would and should step down is if he is sure his replacement would have a much stronger shot of winning the general election. Throwing the dice on an unpredictable disorganized contest, one that might become bitterly divisive and even inspire rioting or violence at a Chicago Democratic Party convention, does not meet that bar.</p>
   <p>By the time of the convention, the identity of the Democratic nominee will be a <em>fait accompli</em>. Not-really-elected delegates will not decide, and should not decide. There are two supedelegates. They will decide.</p>
   <p>The first superdelegate, of course, is Joe Biden himself. The second superdelegate is Kamala Harris. No change of ticket can occur without Harris' enthusiastic endorsement.</p>
   <p>One way to win her endorsement is to put Harris at the head of the ticket. That might be a reasonable option! But observers underestimate Harris by presuming that she herself — me! me! me! — is the only alternative candidate that she would endorse. Harris ran in a Presidential primary, and withdrew quickly when she realized the electoral stars would not align for her.</p>
   <p>The Biden-<i>Harris</i> Administration will study the politics of potential tickets as best it can. There may be some degree of bias, some tendency to overestimate the strengths and underestimate the deficiencies of a Harris-led ticket. But <em>some</em> degree of bias will be a limited degree of bias. If the Biden-Harris Administration comes internally to a conclusion that a different candidate would have a much stronger shot, Harris is not such an egotist that she will risk throwing the country to Donald Trump in exchange for a lottery ticket to become President. Of course, Harris will negotiate a cabinet position for herself, or a quiet promise of favorable consideration should a vacancy arise on the Supreme Court. But she will not stand implacably in the way of whomever the administration determines to be the strongest contender.</p>
   <p>The most likely outcome of all of this is just what it was before the miserable debate. Most likely, the general election will be a contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Biden might be implacably opposed to stepping down. Or, he may be open to the idea, but this delicate, Democratic-Party-internal dance to annoint a credible successor might break down. Some narcissist the administration decides against could take his case to the opinion pages. If there's too much of that, the administration will fall back to the inevitable and deny it ever seriously considered making a change.</p>
   <p>But if ambitious Democrats prove willing to abide a discreet selection process, it is quite possible that the only two people who can choose their successor will do so.</p>
   <p>Paradoxically, the more inevitable a Biden-Harris ticket comes to seem over the next few weeks, the more possible the emergence of an alternative becomes. But in no case is it very likely.</p>

   <p>Since I <a href="2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">tussled</a> — gently I hope! — with <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/">Ned Resnikoff</a>, who is Policy Director of California YIMBY, I want to give credit where it is due.</p>
   <p>California YIMBY <a href="https://cayimby.org/news-events/statement-in-support-of-the-east-solano-plan/">recently came out in favor</a> of the "East Solano Plan", which is bureaucratese for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-forever-promises-new-solano-county-investments/"><em>California Forever</em></a>.</p>
   <p>As I said <a href="2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">before</a>, I favor that project, and wish it every success.</p>
   <p>I am delighted to see CA YIMBY back dense, greenfield development at scale. I think it is the only approach that can match the enormity of our housing problem, a catastrophe that renders life insecure and dystopian for nearly all of us not sitting on equity from a home bought years ago.</p>
   <p>I think ultimately it will <a href="2024/06/07/only-the-state-can-house-us/index.html">take an activist state</a> to jumpstart and "derisk" this project of building new, dense places, in order for it to happen at sufficient scale, and in a diversity of places, not within just superstar metros. Resnikoff <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/p/yimbys-proving-fatalists-wrong">disagrees</a>. Regardless of who is right or wrong in that debate, I am delighted that we share an enthusiasm for dense habitations built on "greenfields", rather than just "infill" development of already inhabited places.</p>
   <p>I know that it is <a href="https://x.com/cafedujord/status/1803290168331489303">difficult</a> <a href="https://x.com/bhargreaves/status/1803491835530133756">for</a> <a href="https://x.com/mnolangray/status/1803322692256584048">California YIMBY</a> to take this position, because most YIMBY activism has been devoted to reforming land-use regulation in support of infill development. Many YIMBYs consider greenfield development inherently "sprawl", an enemy to good, green urbanism.</p>
   <p>I think California YIMBY is right. Dense development is green development, almost wherever it is. It's the density that matters, not the where.</p>
   <p>There are roughly 340 million people in the United States. All of them need to be housed. The "footprint" of that housing, in terms of simple land area, land that can be neither wilderness nor farmland, is solely a function of average density. At suburban densities — call it 2000 humans per square mile — we require 170,000 square miles for our habitat. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density&amp;oldid=1229928813">Paris density</a>, the same 340M people could be accommodated on less than 7000 square miles.</p>
   <p>Density is overwhelmingly the factor that divides green from less-green development. Besides raw land area used, people live more efficiently and ecologically when they live densely. In a suburb you drive to your errands. In a dense city you walk or take transit. There are economies of scale in distribution and infrastructure, especially if you can plan in advance rather than suffering the economic and human costs of retrofitting.</p>
   <p>An exception is when residents would have to commute long distances. But more and more work can be done remotely, or distributed to local offices. People don't like to commute! New residents of new cities will sort themselves, and be disproportionately people who can work in or near their new homes, rather than schlep to some distant city center. Of course it would be great if we built trains to make any schlepping ecological and convenient! But we shouldn't hold our new-city-ing hostage to that. One thing at a time is how anything actually happens.</p>
   <p>Yes, it is great, when we can, to build densely near existing centers of on-site employment. All else equal, such housing that can serve a greater variety of people at lower environmental cost. But wherever we build, if we build densely and at sufficient scale to amortize the cost of urban amenities, we will dramatically reduce both our geographical footprint and the environmental weight of our lifestyles.</p>
   <p>Dense living does not imply cramped living. If we build at midrise or higher, we can accommodate Barcelona to Manhattan densities with generously sized apartments. The elevator is an underrated form of transit.</p>
   <p>Human beings are clever, and people <a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/the-5-coolest-trends-in-urbanism">have gotten very good</a>, especially in Europe and Asia, at planning and building dense, extremely desirable places to live.</p>
   <p>That's the prize.</p>
   <p>We can do it too! And we don't have to confine the work to the geographies where it is hardest to do, to places already inhabited at moderate densities whose residents understandably get grumpy when we come in with our bright eyes to reconfigure their worlds.</p>
   <p>California YIMBY is doing the right thing on the East Solana Plan. However we organize and finance it all, the way we address America's housing <em>and</em> ecological problems at their actual scale is building new dense communities in places now only lightly inhabited.</p>

  <h1><a href="2024/06/15/state-capacity-and-authoritarianism/index.html">State capacity and authoritarianism</a></h1>
 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>One of the drivers of authoritarianism is a sense we just can't get anything done, that solving our multiplying polycrises demands a strongman who can break through the gridlock, get everybody moving in the same direction, actually do stuff.</p>
   <p>It's easy to be antiauthoritarian because you think the wannabe authoritarians are fascists, white supremicists, Christian nationalists, assholes. That's largely true!</p>
   <p>But if your pro-democracy activism is centered around opposing these easy evils, you are countering the weakest rather than the strongest arguments of your opponents. You might or might not win the narrow political squeakers that our electoral system now sets up, but you won't persuade the bulk of the public to any new consensus. And without a new consensus, well, eventually one of these most important elections of our lifetime will be lost, and perhaps that will be that.</p>
   <p>It is in fact correct and true that solving our muliplying polycrises demands a state capable of overcoming narrow vetoes and forging some broad consensus that can break through the gridlock, get most of us moving in the same direction, actually do stuff.</p>
   <p>If you believe in electoral democracy as a <em>practical</em> rather than merely desirable system of government, then you must believe that it is possible for a democratic state to recruit sufficient alignment to meet the challenges that the polity faces.</p>
   <p>If you think that's going to happen by "our side" definitively winning and simply banishing the other side to perpetual marginality, well, that is also what we think that they will do to us. So long as that's the plan, each side will think of themselves as the anti-authoritarian side. Nothing will change, or, even worse, something will.</p>
   <p>If we want <em>genuinely democratic</em> state capacity, state capacity that does not rely on disenfranchising much of the country, we have to address the institutional factors that favor polarization rather than consensus.</p>
   <p>We have to <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7828.html">move past a narrow majoritarianism</a> — which is a much weaker basis for democratic legitimacy than proponents on "our side" often pretend — towards a system in which most of the public feels on-board, rather than either winning or shut out.</p>
   <p>If Democrats are really pro-democracy, they have to do more than argue only reelecting them can save democracy. They must bequeath to the public a system in which citizens actually have meaningful choices, rather than cling to and capitalize on an <em>it's-us-or-Adolf</em> dynamic. Are Democrats pro-democracy, or just pro conditions that help them win their next election?</p>
   <p>The reforms I favor Congress could pass in a day. Elections for single-winner, at-large positions like Senator and President should be by <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">approval voting</a>, which favors candidates everyone can live with over candidates that members of conflictual factions most ardently support, and which encourages the emergence of multiple parties. Elections to the House of Representative should be by some form of proportional representation, whether it's my unlikely dorky favorite (<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7043.html">random ballot</a>), a conventional party-list based system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single-transferable-vote</a>, or the clever hybrid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">MMP</a>.</p>
   <p>Perhaps you have different reforms in mind. This is a democracy! But you are not objectively pro-democracy if you are not working to reform a system that, by virtue of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">widely understood social dynamics</a>, will predictably, recurringly, almost inevitably, yield polarization, gridlock, and incapacity.</p>
   <p>States are the <em>sine qua non</em> of human capability. A certain kind of libertarian might resent this, but it's obviously true. Human achievement and flourishing stratify across borders, favoring states that act and act well over states incapable of acting or that act poorly.</p>
   <p>In a different era, when communication technology had not so completely tamed geography, the deficiencies of the US political system were <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">kept in check</a> by the diversity of an all-politics-is-local world.</p>
   <p>Now all politics is national. Dysfunction latent in our arrangements has emerged, a blister burst, a festival of maggots dancing in the wound. We're not going to uninvent the internet. Our national state will yield little but polarization, gridlock, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pay_auction">all-pay auctions</a> in favor of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7759.html">political consultants</a>, until we change the institutions that structure it.</p>
   <p>We <a href="2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">need state capacity</a> now more than ever. We can do better than succumb to authoritarianism or <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/bourne/1918/war-is-the-health-of-the-state.html">gin up some war</a> to find it.</p>
   <p>But we <em>will</em> do one of those things if we don't do anything else to restore a capable state.</p>
   <p>Electoral reform is possible. It is easy. Nothing is more urgent, or more hopeful.</p>
