 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>In my post on how why <a href="(##right-wing-higher-ed)">higher education is shockingly right-wing</a>, some libertarian commentators didn't like this:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>If "left" and "right" have any meaning at all, "right" describes a worldview under which civilized society depends upon legitimate hierarchy, and a key object of politics is properly defining and protecting that hierarchy.</p>
    <p>"Left", on the other hand, is animated by antipathy to hierarchy, by an egalitarianism of dignity. While left-wing movements recognize that effective institutions must place people in different roles — sometimes hierarchical, sometimes associated with unequal rewards — these are contingent, often problematic, overlays upon a foundational assertion that every human being has equal dignity and equal claim to the fundamental goods of human life.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>That, dear reader, is about the best and most concise explanation of left and right as you are ever going to get.</p>
   <p>But my libertarian friends hate it! Here's <a href="https://www.timworstall.com/2023/03/so-let-us-take-interfluidity-seriously-for-a-moment/">Tim Worstall</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Therefore markets – and free markets more especially – are not a right wing idea. For the entire point about the free in free markets is that absolutely anyone gets to try overturning that hierarchy. And, often enough, succeeds. Apple fucked over AT&amp;T rather nicely, Whitney’s cotton gin entirely shafted the linen and wool weavers, Aldi and Lidl cost Sainsbury’s shareholders billion upon billion.</p>
    <p>Which means that the left embraces markets as those hierarchy overturning engines that they are. Right?</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Ah, Tim. Markets are not just ideas. They are actual practices and institutions, which occur in the context of real societies and lived circumstances.</p>
   <p>Free markets were indeed a left-wing practice, several hundred years ago, when an ascendant bourgeoisie, bound only by the spontaneous organization of market logics, overturned the feudal hierarchies that had dominated Europe until then.</p>
   <p>Markets can be anti-hierarchy, and when they are, yes, they are on the left! "Classical liberals" used to be at war with the traditional right, remember?</p>
   <p>But what if, today, we talk about Marin County.</p>
   <p>Marin County, for those who don't know, is an exclave of San Francisco. It's the spit of land immediately across the Golden Gate Bridge from the city proper. It is breathtakingly beautiful. Its towns — places like <a href="https://www.sausalito.gov/">Sausalito</a>, <a href="https://www.cityofmillvalley.org/">Mill Valley</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larkspur,_California">Larkspur</a>, <a href="https://www.townofsananselmo.org/">San Anselmo</a>, <a href="https://www.townoffairfax.org/">Fairfax</a>, and <a href="https://www.townoftiburon.org/">Tiburon</a> — are contemporary paradises: safe, culturally lively, brimming with small-town charm but only a short drive from the big city.</p>
   <p>And Marin County is impeccably progressive! Everywhere you go, you will see the signs:</p>

You'll have to take my word, dear reader, as someone who really enjoys Marin County and has spent a lot of time there, that signs of this sort are in fact common.</em></p>

   <p>Perhaps Tim and I would agree that there's something a bit hypocritical in all this progressivism. Everyone really is welcome in Marin! (Well, not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolinas,_California">Bolinas</a>, that's a different story.)</p>
   <p>Everyone is welcome, but a modest home will cost you a couple of million dollars. Those charming towns are incredibly segregated, racially and economically.</p>
   <p>The residents of Marin, like university professors, are perfectly sincere in their progressivism, as far as it goes. Yet, the residents of Marin assiduously defend exclusive access to extraordinary desirable places to live without erecting a single physical gate. All they need is the housing market, under land-use rules that serve both to preserve the extraordinary charm of their communities and to keep housing scarce.</p>
   <p>Perhaps that's not the market Tim would prefer! But it is the market we actually have.</p>
   <p>Matt Yglesias sometimes <a href="https://tinyletter.com/mattyglesias/letters/what-s-driving-me-is-driving-you">describes</a> his YIMBY preferences with respect to land use as Latin-America-style land reform. And he has a point! If Marin housing markets were made "free" in the way that Matt, and I suspect Tim, would prefer, then they might have a left-wing, anti-hierarchical valence!</p>
   <p>But that is not our world. In our real world, social hierarchies are <em>primarily inscribed via market processes</em>.</p>
   <p><a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7263.html">Quoting myself</a> yet again (fucking narcissist):</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[W]hat it means to live in a stratified society, precisely what it means to live in a stratified society, is that there are objective correlates to position along dimensions that individuals and communities cannot themselves choose. There are positional dimensions whose importance is a social fact, not arbitrary, but real as social facts are, by virtue of their consequences. In such a society, positional goods with desirable correlates, inherently scarce and inelastically supplied, become extremely valuable. In some societies, those goods may be rationed by custom, or by heredity, by caste or race. But to the degree that a society is “liberal” and capitalist, they will be price-rationed, as they largely (but incompletely) are in our American society.</p>
    <p>In a stratified, liberal capitalist society, the ability to command market power, to charge a margin sufficiently above the cost of inputs to cover the purchase of positional goods, becomes the definition of caste.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>If libertarians restricted their support for markets to arrangements and circumstances when they are anti-hierarchical, well, then they would be of the left!</p>
   <p>But very obviously, they do not in practice do that.</p>
   <p>Libertarians share exactly the same pathology as university professors and the smiling residents of Marin County: They flatter themselves that they stand in opposition to vicious social hierarchy, and find true-enough narratives by which to spin their allegiances into support for equal dignity. But their actual practices, the institutions they inhabit and animate and from which they earn their succor, belie all that.</p>
   <p>Contemporary libertarians are, um, quite disproportionately winners under current market arrangements. And they assiduously support those arrangements. They do not, for example, condition their support of markets on continuing rigorous competition to ensure that no economic rents accumulate. Libertarians are not like a certain stripe of socialist, whining that socialism has never really been tried. Libertarians say that capitalism has been tried, and it works great.</p>
   <p>But under actually existing capitalism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew effects</a> rule the day. Markets may be notionally "free", but past winners (humans, not just firms) have tremendous advantage. Certain classes of people understand that market arrangements are likely to continue to deliver <em>to them</em> security and abundance, but will sadly deliver those goods much less adequately to other groups whose continuing misfortune, despite occasional bootstrap stories, we can pretty well predict.</p>
   <p>Markets, under these circumstances, become a locus of hierarchy, rather than a challenge to it.</p>
   <p>Which is why, despite protestations about loving freedom and encouragements to individual pluck, contemporary libertarians quite correctly identify as of the right.</p>

  <h1><a href="2023/03/08/dilution-of-faction-requires-voting-system-reform/index.html">Dilution of faction requires voting system reform</a></h1>
 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p><a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/james-madisons-vision-of-pluralism/">David French</a> argues we can "dilute the disruptive power of faction by allowing factions to bloom."</p>
   <p>He commends to us James Madison, writing <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493273">Federalist No. 10</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government...renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other...</p>
    <p>The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>The logic is, in principle, very appealing. When there is a wide diversity of factions, no single group can command a majority and do mischief. Majorities will have to be cobbled together across factional and party lines, echo chambers of parochial interest will have to be broken by compromise. Something like a general interest that transcends in-group loyalties will have to emerge in order to pass legislation.</p>
   <p>When Madison wrote, he was trying to build support for binding the American states into a new Union. He was eager to claim that a larger and more diverse polity will yield a higher, not lower, quality of government.</p>
   <p>(In other words, James Madison was the first "diversity is our strength" guy. Eat that my <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html">fascist</a> friends.)</p>
   <p>I am, um, constitutionally sympathetic to these ideas. But as the Union has evolved, two developments have badly undermined them.</p>
   <p>The first is technology. In a world of near-instant interconnection across any distance, it is a several-times-a-daily occurrence for "factious leaders" to spread very general conflagrations.</p>
   <p>In 1787, what would become the inaugural 13 states amounted to a vast polity, full of disparate places whose particular passions might easily swallowed by distance. In 2023, our 50 discontinuous states are just one cramped corner of the "global village". The effect of contemporary communications technologies has been to magnify systematic signals while averaging away idiosyncratic local diversity as though it were only noise. Relative to the range of flames that might be kindled by factious leaders, the extent of the proposed Union was large in Madison's day. Now our much larger Union is a one crowded forest in a bone dry summer, eager for the tiniest spark.</p>
   <p>The effects of technology may be hard to remedy. But the second problem is entirely self-inflicted.</p>
   <p>Madison counseled that factions should be small and many. But our single-winner, first-past-the-post voting system <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">exerts a social gravity</a> that pulls us into two, gigantic factions of similar size.</p>
   <p>Madison's Constitution doesn't specify a voting system, so this one isn't on him. But I really wish prominent modern-day admirers of Madison — like David French! — would be a bit more specific and constructive when offering paeans to dilution of faction. If we want multiple factions, we understand how to design voting systems that encourage and support that, rather than the voting system we have, which punishes any divergence from the two major parties.</p>
   <p>For legislatures, we could adopt any of the many voting systems that tend towards proportional representation, including</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">mixed-member proportional</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single-transferable vote</a>, or</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation">traditional party list</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Alternatively, we could really honor Madison's ghost and reprise our 1780s-era verve by jumping straight to something innovative, like</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1-1-1984-Choosing-Representatives-by-Lottery-Voting-Amar/6fd70eabac758800771f8baf880e7064cf361aa3?p2df">random ballot</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9069.html">mass representative democracy</a>, or</li>
    <li><a href="https://equalitybylot.com/">sortition</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>For positions that are inherently single-winner (like Mayor, Governor, or President), we could adopt systems like</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>that do not punish "minor" parties as spoilers.</p>
   <p><a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/">Ranked-choice voting</a> is another popular choice. I'm not a huge fan, but it's better than our terrible <em>status quo</em>!</p>
   <p>If you think democracy would work better with a more pluralistic ecosystem of factions, it's no good just to endorse and exhort. We are stuck in an equilibrium with two uber-factions, and we perfectly well understand why. If you mean to remedy that, <em>please specifically advocate voting system reform!</em></p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p><em>After I ranted this to my friend <a href="https://wealtheconomics.substack.com/">Steve Roth</a>, he suggested I write it up. In substance, it's a retread of my <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5149.html">welfare economics series</a>, especially the second installment, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5212.html">Perils of Potential Pareto</a>.</em></p>
   <p><em>That series is the best economics writing I've ever done! But this is shorter and more ranty.</em></p>
   <ul>
    <li><p>In the beginning, there were they were just Benthamites. The greatest good for the greatest number, all of that. But they were always ambitious fucks. It was never enough for them to have a view, their view had to be writ, had to be <em>science</em>. You can <em>claim</em> that this or that action produces the greatest good for the greatest number, but how do you measure it? How do you prove it? Suppose you with the same resources you can feed ten people or entertain a thousand. Feeding a hungry person is a greater good, perhaps, than entertaining a fat one, but how much greater? Is it only 90 times the greater good, in which case the resources should go straight to Broadway, or 101 times the greater good, in which case the soup kitchen should get it? Benthamites could opine, but they could not <em>measure</em>. They had no means by which to persuasively contradict cretins who would make the opposite call.</p></li>
    <li><p>So, they declared economics an <em>empirical</em> science. "Henceforth," they shouted, about a century ago, "we shall base our conclusions only upon what we can (at least in principle) measure!" <em>Utility</em>, the phlogisten of the Benthamite creed, the hypothetical substance of good that was to be maximized across a population, was recast as "ordinal". We cannot know whether one hungry person's meal is worth more or less than 100 feted people's entertainment. But we can know that the hungry person, given a choice, will choose the meal over the musical. We can order and rank the value of goods to an individual, even if we can't measure the distance or difference between them, or make comparisons across different people. And, thanks to our man <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto</a>, we can offer a <em>scientific</em>, <em>empirical</em>, can't-dispute-this-motherfucker account of the good. If some action or policy will make <em>at least one person</em> better off (i.e. they would choose their new circumstance over their old), and make <em>no other people worse off</em> that, that, is indisputable an improvement. Here is a criterion that involves only observable (at least "in principle") rankings, and that requires no comparisons of unmeasurable welfare across different people! Hurrah! Those cretins have to listen to us now.</p></li>
    <li><p>Only. At the level of public policy, where economists aspire to rule (for the betterment of all, of course), there are almost no actions that meet the Pareto criterion. If you want to build a new public park for free, there is always some motherfucker who <em>loves</em> the wild shrubbery already there and <em>hates</em> the idea that loud, laughing children might interrupt his afternoon idyll. If (as economists always did) you want to open the borders to trade, there is always someone who will be put out of work by cheaper imports. The Pareto criterion was arguably <em>scientific</em>, but, as John Hicks famously <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2225023">put it</a>, this "economic positivism might easily become an excuse for the shirking of live issues, very conducive to the euthanasia of our science." And without our science, all that will be left are the cretins.</p></li>
    <li><p>So, Hicks, along with <a href="https://www.hujingbei.net/upload/2007_11/07110714361173.pdf">Nicholas Kaldor</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1907054">Harold Hotelling</a> came up with a workaround. Render unto the cretin the things which are the cretin's, but unto the economist the things which are the economist's. The economist cannot make claims about who should get what, the ten hungry people or the thousand fat circus-goers. That is a judgment of <em>values</em>. It is beyond science, so must be left to the cretins and their <em>politics</em>. However, we can observe whether some action would create a situation where <em>if</em> you taxed some of the people who would very much prefer the new situation <em>and</em> gave the proceeds to the people who would otherwise be grumpy about it, then <em>everyone</em> would prefer (or at worst be indifferent) to the new reality. If economists <em>require</em> the cretins — err, politicians — to actually perform this redistribution in order for it to be scored "efficient", then it is just the Pareto criterion. But, of course, economists knew very well that politicians would not in fact usually redistribute to make real some hypothetical Kumbaya. So they washed their hands of it. If everyone <em>could have been made</em> better, or at least no worse off, by an action <em>if some redistribution had occured</em>, then clearly the action itself "makes the pie bigger". We can score it as <em>scientifically</em> more efficient. That the cretins are unwilling to do the distribution? Hey, that's a values question, not our problem. Economists again could don the authority of science to tell us all what must be done. NAFTA is <em>efficient</em>! You don't understand arithmetic if you disagree.</p></li>
    <li><p>But oh no! It turns out (curse the name of <a href="https://www.hujingbei.net/upload/2007_11/07110714376633.pdf">Tibor de Scitovsky</a>!) this criterion of <em>potential</em> Pareto improvement is not an ordering. There are actions where, if we were to perform the action, the "winners" could compensate the "losers", and they would all be better off. But if we do not <em>actually</em> compensate the losers, <em>reversing the same action</em> and letting the initial losers compensate the undoing of the winners might <em>also</em> make everybody better off! (For a detailed treatment of this, follow the pictures <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5212.html">here</a>.) It is <em>incoherent</em> to declare something an efficiency improvement and then declare its reversal an efficiency improvement, but that is the <em>cul de sac</em> our poor scientists had backed themselves into. To this very day, economists do not have a practical criterion by which to declare an action or policy authoritatively "efficient", should cretins have the temerity to disagree. (There is the Pareto criterion, of course, in theory.)</p></li>
    <li><p>To really twist the knife, one economist examined the cycles Scitovsky had discovered and concluded this problem was very general. In a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2023/03/06/P41.pdf">Rand Corporation note</a> that was the foundation of a celebrated, seminal result, this economist acknowledged, "the compensation principal does not provide a true ordering of social decisions. It is the purpose of this note to show that this phenomenon is very general."</p></li>
    <li><p>That economist was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</a>, and if you've taken any economics at all, you've probably learned about the result that emerged from the Rand note. It is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem">Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</a>. But when you learned about that result, I bet you didn't learn that its original object was the <em>impossibility</em> of authoritative technocracy. Social actions cannot in general be ranked under the ordinal utility constraint economists impose upon themselves. Instead, you learned that it was about the impossibility of a good <em>voting system</em>, if we impose the constraints economists invented for themselves upon how we conceive of voting systems!</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>In other words, after struggling for decades to come up with a basis to make authoritative claims beyond politics, the economics profession realized by about 1950 that, at least on the terms they had prescribed for themselves, it was impossible. They had no criterion, and could have no criterion, by which they could elevate their conclusions as "scientific" and above the fray. What was to be done? Well, we know what they did.</p>
   <p>They took the weapon they invented, this theorem that damned their own authority, and they pointed it at the rest of us. They stopped talking about the impossibility of ranking social actions, but loudly proclaimed their theorem foreclosed the possibility of coherent democratic choice. If someone must be silenced by this discovery, it would not be <em>our profession</em>, it will be the cretins, the quarrelsome public with its crass politics.</p>
   <p>Our voting systems as we actually understand them are not, in fact, touched by the impossibility theorem, because we generally conceive of votes in <em>cardinal</em> rather than <em>ordinal</em> terms. Economists forbid themselves interpersonal comparisons, but in politics we have no trouble asserting that <em>my vote expresses a preference of the same weight as yours</em>. What economists foreswore because they could not measure, in politics we impose as an axiom on normative grounds.</p>
   <p>We are taught that Arrow's theorem condemns democracy when in fact it condemns economic technocracy. That doesn't mean voting systems <em>can</em> be made perfect: It remains true that no voting system meets all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_criteria">many, sometimes conflicting, criteria</a> we might desire of one. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard%27s_theorem">no deterministic voting system is immune</a> from strategic voting when there are more than two candidates. (We should consider <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7043.html">stochastic voting systems!</a>)</p>
   <p>Still, I find it breathtaking. This very result that economists understood perfectly well meant they had no sound basis for judging social action with authority beyond other approaches, they (we?) marketed as damning the other approaches.</p>
   <p>Economists are such scoundrels.</p>

   <p>Living in Florida, I <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/florida-bill-would-require-bloggers-who-write-about-governor-to-register-with-the-state/">am</a> <a href="https://www.nysun.com/article/desantis-ally-in-florida-wants-to-rewrite-landmark-libel-law">giving</a> <a href="https://pen.org/florida-book-bans-empty-shelves/">some</a> <a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/ultimate-cancel-act-florida-democratic-party/43125234">thought</a> to the question of fascism. What is it? Why does it come to be? How do its pathologies emerge? What, if any, are its virtues?</p>
   <p>Obviously there are legions of academics who write and debate and parade on MSNBC about this stuff. I defer to their authority. I'm trying to work stuff out for myself, from my own observations and understanding of the world. I expect the result will be incomplete and inadequate.</p>
   <p>The use of fascism as an epithet, as a kind of rhetorical "cooties" that discredits whomever can be somehow associated with it, prevents us from thinking clearly about a phenomenon whose roots go too deep to simply shun away.</p>
   <p>Fascism, I think, represents an approach to solving the key problem of modern nation-states: How do we build and sustain a capacity for effective social coordination over scales so large that people's interests and identities are likely to be diverse and conflictual?</p>
   <p>Liberal approaches take diversity and disagreement as axiomatic. They strive to build institutions of coordination that accommodate difference and are resilient to it.</p>
   <p>Fascist approaches, on the other hand, see diversity and disagreement as obstacles to fruitful coordination that are malleable. If coordination at scale is hard because people disagree, what if we could make them disagree less?</p>
   <p>Right here a core dispute between liberalism and fascism emerges. The contemporary liberal slogan "diversity is our strength" (which fascists signally mock) is based on the idea that with diversity comes a kind of collective intelligence or capability. But even at an individual level, intelligence has a Hamlet problem. Intelligent people weigh conflicting viewpoints, and may sometimes be slower to act than a person who acts briskly on impulse. Smart people dither.</p>
   <p>Most of us would acknowledge that, on balance, it is better to weigh multiple perspectives and ideas prior to acting, even though doing so consumes time and resources. But we would also concede that there are limits to desirable deliberation. A person may contain multitudes so divergent and clamorous that he becomes paralyzed, indecisive.</p>
   <p>Liberalism emphasizes the risks of acting unintelligently, while fascism emphasizes the risks of failing to act. That may be a high-minded dispute, but things get a bit muckier once we drill into how societies render diversity malleable.</p>
   <p>To a first — <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6632.html">I think inadequate!</a> — approximation, liberal societies can't and don't, they accept diversity and celebrate it. Fascist societies, on the other hand, are fundamentally characterized by the <em>means</em> they use to engender social consensus, to bind together the famous <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/459504/fasces-fascism-and-how-the-alt-right-continues-to-appropriate-ancient-roman-symbols/">fasces</a>.</p>
   <p>In particular they</p>
   <ol>
    <li><p>Conflate the state with a personalist leader, then sacralize the state;</p></li>
    <li><p>Define enemies, internal and external, who menace the sacred state and leader;</p></li>
    <li><p>Attribute to those enemies any form of dissent that the leader/state deems problematic;</p></li>
    <li><p>Punish those they mark as enemies or collaborators harshly; and</p></li>
    <li><p>Control or suppress media to prevent subversion by enemies.</p></li>
   </ol>
   <p>This can be an effective recipe for encouraging consensus and easing coordination at scale!</p>
   <p>The carrot is the cult. Humans have a natural inclination to submit to virtues that transcend ourselves, and the sacred state embodied in the loving leader is an attractive outlet for this inclination. Most fascists don't perceive themselves as villains or sycophants. They perceive themselves as patriots. The sacralized state ceases to be an institution for wielding coercive power, but becomes indistinguishable from the <em>volk</em>, the virtuous people.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
   <p>The stick, of course, is inimicalization: becoming defined as the enemy. You are with us or you are against us. There are no nuances, no third ways. If you are against us, you are the enemy. The least you can expect is exile. As Putin <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/03/16/russia-putin-issues-warning-to-scum-traitors-who-he-will-spit-out-like-a-midge-16290186/">put it</a>, "Any people, and especially the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths."</p>
   <p>If you are an enemy and you do not leave, you will be persecuted. The fascist tendency does not require, or even <em>usually</em> result in, persecution to the point of extermination. But that is the direction of the logic. <em>In extremis</em>, in crisis, fascist orders, like most social orders, will double-down on their logics when they seem to have failed, rather than concede and accept reform that discredits the reigning establishment.</p>
   <p>Fascism requires its enemies. It is no coincidence that the <a href="https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/the-temptations-of-carl-schmitt">man who defined politics around a chasm of friend vs enemy</a> became the political theorist of the Third Reich. If there are not at first obvious enemies threatening the sacred state, then soon there will be, there must be. They will be invented, discovered, provoked, because without the enemy threat, there is insufficient cause and therefore insufficient social capacity to suppress the unruliness that fascism exists to overcome.</p>
   <p>The fascist state and the fascist citizen are capable of anything. They are not bound by bourgeois morality, because they are the ones menaced and victimized by enemies internal and external. The offenses they commit are always, with a deeper analysis, acts of self-defense. It is the enemy who must bear the moral responsibility.</p>
   <p>This attitude creates license, which increases the capacity of a fascist order (relative to systems more prone to moral noise) to execute goal-directed, coordinated social action. It explains why fascist state action often seems immoral to outsiders but virtuous to insiders.</p>
   <p>But while a fascist order may act more freely and more quickly than competitors, it may also act more stupidly. Systems that consider diverse perspectives and weigh options carefully have their virtues too.</p>
   <p>Regarding enemies, it's worth noting that social arrows usually go both ways, and an undeniable threat that cannot plausibly be described as ginned-up will reproduce much of the logic of fascism even in states whose leaderships and publics may not be ideologically inclined to it. Every country at war, when the stakes grow sufficiently high, makes an idol of the state and of victory, identifies forms of dissent threatening to the existing state as collaboration (intentional or in effect) with the enemy, and persecutes those perceived as actual or likely collaborators. There are <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/02/ukraine-censorship-authoritarianism-illiberalism-crackdown-police-zelensky">few surprises here</a>.</p>
   <p>An existential conflict really is (in the phrase made famous by Nazi theorist Schmitt) a state of exception. Fascism can be understood as a means of rendering permanent the clarity, conformity, and collective decisiveness that publics usually tolerate only when they perceive exceptional threat.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Perhaps the stupidest idea that everyone takes for granted is that higher education in the United States is left-wing.</p>
   <p>If "left" and "right" have any meaning at all, "right" describes a worldview under which civilized society depends upon legitimate hierarchy, and a key object of politics is properly defining and protecting that hierarchy.</p>
   <p>"Left", on the other hand, is animated by antipathy to hierarchy, by an egalitarianism of dignity. While left-wing movements recognize that effective institutions must place people in different roles — sometimes hierarchical, sometimes associated with unequal rewards — these are contingent, often problematic, overlays upon a foundational assertion that every human being has equal dignity and equal claim to the fundamental goods of human life.</p>
   <p>Whatever else colleges and universities do in the United States, they define and police our most consequential social hierarchy, the dividing line between a prosperous <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7263.html">if precarious</a> professional class and a larger, often immiserated, working class. The credentials universities provide are no guarantee of escape from paycheck-to-paycheck living, but statistically they are a near prerequisite.</p>
   <p>The academy itself is incredibly hierarchical. Within a university, distinctions reign between a graduate student or postdoc, an adjunct, an assistant professor on tenure track, an associate versus full professor. These ranks are salient and consequential, treated as legitimate and earnestly policed.</p>
   <p>Nothing is spared hierarchy in academia. Institutions are organized into pecking orders. Harvard University and Towson University are not the same. Everyone understands their relative rank, the <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803104247382;jsessionid=A3607E3AA98E806AB399FC75DC2F9817">social consequences of which</a> are very real.</p>
   <p>If you are an academic at a level beyond community college or adjunct professorship, you have devoted your life to swimming upstream, besting competitors who will relegated to lower ranks or simply expectorated from academic life. It is a key part of your job to rank and sort other people, whether they be the undergrads that you grade or the faculty your department hires. You strive to have your work published in "top-tier" journals.</p>
   <p>To be an academic and be left-wing is like being a fish opposed to water. It is not persuasive. Or it ought not to be.</p>
   <p>Of course it is true that the vast majority of professors "identify" as progressive or liberal or left. That is understandable! At a mass-level, the left-wing view that we are fundamentally equal in dignity has won the day. Even political movements that claim to be right-wing, that act overtly to defend and entrench social hierarchies, must pay lip-service to egalitarian norms to have any success in our electral democracy.</p>
   <p>Professors are people too. They don't like to think of themselves as the bone structure of our society's most consequentially oppressive hierarchy. At an individual level, they are wonderful people. And they are smart. They understand at some level that their role is problematic. But, individually, there is nothing they can do about that. They could opt out, cede their slot to the next striver, but that wouldn't change anything about the structure of our society and the role of academia within it. But it would cost them personally, tremendously.</p>
   <p>So, successful academics hew a path quite analogous to that taken by so many graduates of the prestigious schools they run. "I'll work at McKinsey, or Goldman, or Google, because doing so will provide me with resources to do some good, later, somehow." Academics, like most of us, would prefer a less hierarchical society, but they tell themselves that the best they can do is gain some social power by... contending for an elite position inside the hierarchy and using whatever influence comes from that to further a less hierarchical ideal. This attempt to use the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/291810-for-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house">master's tools to dismantle the master's house</a> is not very convincing on its face, so academics have to work unusually hard to convince themselves that they are not bad people. This encourages an unusually expressive and radical politics.</p>
   <p>Universities become bastions of an ostentatious "leftism" even while these same leftists perform the workaday labor of sorting and excluding upon which our stratified society depends. I'm not a fan of psychological explanations for political difference, but it does seem a touch neurotic.</p>
   <p>It is also counterproductive, in two respects:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><p>While <em>individually</em> academics may be helpless to affect the unequal distributions of dignity and deserts which their vocations undergird, collectively they have tremendous capacity to reform and reshape academia. Instead of taking pride in how exclusive their institutions are, professors could work as a group to discredit the conflation of exclusivity and merit. If a Harvard degree is so valuable, professors could insist the university franchise as liberally as McDonalds and grow the freshman class to tens of thousands. That should be practical, if the value-add is actual education. If Harvard's value to undergraduates is based on scarcity and social connection, well maybe that's the kind of institution the very best academics, if their political commitments are real, should refuse — <em>as an organized class, rather than as ineffectually expressive individuals</em> — to participate in at all.</p></li>
    <li><p>The combination of flamboyant left-wing expression and bitterly exclusive hierarchical norms that nearly everyone has experienced directly (perhaps at a high-school level when they were sorted as unlikely to be college material) discredits left-wing political activism broadly as a sham.</p> <p>Right-wing grievance entrepreneurs complain that they have been locked out of the institutions and must make a long march to retake them. They pretend that Gramsci and Marcuse have won the culture for "the left" and their only hope is some desperate hail mary. Don't be a fucking idiot and take them at their word.</p> <p>Right-wing grievance entrepreneurs go after higher education because its role in politics is incoherent and hypocritical, in a way that the public viscerally experiences. Universities are attacked not because "the left" is strong within them, but because the academy's paperthin but shouty commitment to equal dignity makes it easy to present the whole left project as a sham, a trojan horse by which some sanctimonious elite is going to jam down arrangements under which <em>their</em> dignity and prosperity will somehow always be first among equals.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Academia is right-wing, structurally. Diversifying academia in the conventional sense, bringing more members of underrepresented groups into higher rungs of the hierarchy, would not alter that fact. Left academics who analyze structural injustice so assiduously might take this obvious reality into greater account.</p>
   <p>Because as things stand, while academics sanctimoniously (and correctly!) opine about fascism and structural racism, the institutions they serve have become ever more consequential gatekeepers in an ever more extractive relationship with the students they purport to serve. Perhaps there are causes more proximate than 1619 why the public has become predisposed not to take alarms rung by earnest professors at face value.</p>
