 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Banks are not private businesses.</p>
   <p>Yes, of course, they do pretend to be. They are listed on stock markets. They take the organizational form of a private business. Their profits are definitely privatized.</p>
   <p>But their risk is borne almost entirely by the state. Beyond a small sliver of equity and bonds sits a vast ocean of "deposits" that the state guarantees, explicitly via "deposit insurance", tacitly far beyond that.</p>
   <p>"Deposit insurance" itself is a pretense. Recall that the first thing FDIC did during the 2008 financial crisis was more than double its insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000. What kind of insurance company <em>increases</em> the limit of the insurance it provides at just the moment claims become likely to be made? What kind of insurance company lets you multiply your insuredness for free if you perform bureaucratic busywork that does not in anyway mitigate the underlying risk, like split your deposits between an account in your name and a joint account, or form a <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/diguidebankers/documents/revocable.pdf">trust</a> that's still yours unless you die?</p>
   <p>FDIC is not "limited deposit insurance". When it was founded, perhaps it was intended to be that. But <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2017/ec-201717-origins-of-too-big-to-fail">by the early 1970s</a>, as the strict prudential regulation that emerged during the Great Depression was slowly whittled away, anyone paying attention came to understand that the state's role in banking goes far beyond an insurance product, maybe on slightly subsidized terms. With an insurance company, it's usually a bit of a struggle to get claims paid. The companies are trying to minimize payouts. With FDIC, it is an extraordinary event when notionally <em>uninsured</em> depositors are not made whole. It does occasionally happen! But it is the exception, not the rule. It results from the sin of keeping deposits beyond FDIC's notional limit in a bank so minor and insignificant its customers can be sacrificed to the project of maintaining appearances. It must appear that FDIC is an insurance company with a statutory obligation to minimize costs. It must appear that banks are private companies that are required, as many businesses are, to purchase certain insurance products in order to protect customers or workers.</p>
   <p>Whether the resolution of a bank — or, more usually, a cluster of banks, since bank failures are not independent events — will ultimately be cheap or costly to "the taxpayer" depends almost entirely upon regulation and supervision prior to the resolution. FDIC (and the Treasury, and Fed) can <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/12/unlimited-deposit-insurance/index.html">play various games</a> to limit the impact of resolution on the Deposit Insurance Fund, like levying fees to other banks that will be passed along to taxpayers in their role of bank customers (or that would be, if bank profits were disciplined by competition). But the cost of a bank resolution will always be the size of the hole in the banks' balance sheet that supervisors have allowed to emerge before resolving the bank. All FDIC can do is allocate (or obfuscate) the cost.</p>
   <p>That said, bank resolutions needn't be costly! When supervisors do their job — when the state uses the tools at its disposal to aggressively <em>manage</em> this risk of banks that the state almost entirely bears — banks are prevented from taking risks that will make the bankers rich if things work out, but leave a crater in their balance sheet if they don't. When supervisors actually do take <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fdicia">"prompt corrective action"</a>, they can prevent balance sheet holes from growing very large, and so minimize the cost of resolving a bank.</p>
   <p>Bank resolutions needn't be costly, though of course often they are. The bank failures attending the 2008 financial crisis and the 1980s S&amp;L crisis were not cheap.</p>
   <p>But people spend far too much energy worrying about the cost of bank failures and far too little worrying about the cost of bank survival.</p>
   <p>Banks are not private businesses. Their risk is borne almost entirely by the state, so the state tilts the playing field to ensure that overt, embarrassing, disruptive bank failures are suppressed. No one objects (except the bankers) when this takes the form of supervision and prudential regulation. But the most costly forms of state support take the form of subsidies that the state can pretend are not "taxpayer funded", but that impose quiet costs on the public anyway. Do you remember when the Fed <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1160447599.shtml">retroactively rewrote millions of lending contracts</a> so that banks could charge more interest and recapitalize? Do you remember when the nation debt <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=11AvT">doubled in less than four years</a>, precisely so that large banks would <em>not</em> have to be resolved? <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2587.html">Yes, Virginia.</a> Bank failures, actually, are much less expensive than the things we do to fill holes in bank balance sheets so we need never acknowledge their failures.</p>
   <p>Apropos nothing, check out this <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm">Bank Term Funding Program</a>! Valued at par. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
   <p>Meanwhile, since we pretend banks are private businesses, we let shareholders and managers siphon off wealth while banks take risks on behalf of the state, and then again as they skim from the opaque subsidies the state pours into them when things go sour.</p>
   <p>It is a good thing, not a bad thing, that the risk of aggregate investment is ultimately borne by the state. I am sometimes asked whether I really believe that our choices are to tolerate something on the verge of fraud or <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2669.html">revert to goat-herding</a>. The answer is no, I don't believe that. Even though historically private bank finance emerges — very productively! — at the edge of fraud, we now have states that can overtly undertake investment risks on our collective behalf that we as individuals would not consent to take with our own resources. The state already is the bank. What's left is to acknowledge that and, importantly, to devise an institutional structure for state-backed development finance that is not so obfuscated and corrupt and shell-gamish as contemporary banking, but that also avoids the pathologies of overtly politicized lending.</p>
   <p>Once upon a time, I might have been persuaded that it's a good thing that banking overtly looks like private finance, even while covertly it mobilizes the resources of the state. The theory is that it's much better to have investment mobilized on commercial terms than on political terms, and the pretextual privateness of contemporary banking permits that. You don't want a world in which state resources are mobilized based on political connectedness or populist fads rather than investment quality.</p>
   <p>The proof is in the pudding, though. The contemporary "private" financial system is shit. It can mobilize resources stupidly — secured against collateral like real-estate, or against least-common-denominator "hard information" like credit scores. But it no longer performs its most essential task: ferreting out and funding <a href="https://syntheticassets.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/what-banks-do-monetize-human-capital/">good <em>uncollateralized</em> loans</a>. It creates rivers of financial flows from the poor and disorganized to the rich and well-connected. It has profitably, but contrary to domestic public interest, underwritten the near total offshoring of critical industrial capabilities in ways that overtly public finance, whatever else its flaws, would never have allowed. It finances consolidation of industry, and helps <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3649879">organize shareholders into tacit cartels</a>. For all of its privateness and supposed commercial orientation, contemprary finance is hardly immune to cronyism.</p>
   <p>Despite the obvious pathologies of our politics — in part <em>because</em> those pathologies are obvious and public — I think we would be better off reorganizing finance, disentangling deposits and payments entirely from risk investment, ensuring credit availability by having the state explicitly support investment funds dedicated to forms of economic development we decide are prosocial.</p>
   <p>Of course there will be scandals. It is an institutional reality that private sector business aggressively markets itself as virtuous, despite its unhidden thirst to maximize the rents it can extract, while the public sector is subject to eternal scrutiny, under which every failure to live up to an ideal of public spiritedness is treated as discrediting of the entire enterprise. But the public sector succeeds at least partially at virtues that the private sector does not even pretend to attempt. The private sector is precisely in the business of doing the self-interested things that in the public sector get called corruption. It's just not labeled corrupt, because treating aggressively in ones own self-interest is what's expected!</p>
   <p>A better financial system would include investment funds whose private managers, like contemporary banks, enjoy outsized gains in exchange for exposure to first loss on state-financed investment. But there would be no prevarification about where the money is coming from. It's coming from the state. It's a mobilization of our collective risk-bearing capacity, towards ends that the broad public supports. The composition of our aggregate investment portfolio — the most important edifice that we all collectively construct — would not be pawned off on anonymous market forces. It is ultimately the responsibility of the democratic state, however imperfect our democracy remains.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Tonight the US Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC delivered a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1337">joint statement</a> in order to staunch the panic provoked by last week's resolution of Silicon Valley Bank. (ht <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@w7voa@journa.host">Steve Herman</a>).</p>
   <p>Regulators shocked the market last week, not because SVB was shut down and put under FDIC receivership, but because initially it seemed like regulators were going to only insure up to the formal $250,000 limit of FDIC insurance, which would leave SVB's many business customers unsure of when and how much of what they had thought were safe bank deposits would ever be recovered.</p>
   <p>Today's joint statement returns us to the post-Great-Financial-Crisis tacit <em>status quo</em>. During the Great Financial Crisis, regulators <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/will-fdic-keep-protecting-failed-banks-uninsured-deposits">created an expectation</a> that customers — at least customers of not-tiny banks — would not lose a penny even of their uninsured deposits in a bank failure. By law, of course, uninsured deposits are, well, uninsured. FDIC is supposed to resolve banks at least-cost to the taxpayer and if that means stiffing uninsured depositors, well, so be it. But in practice, regulators post-GFC have understood that stiffing uninsured depositors makes no sense in our brave new world of banking, and have <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/2019/spoct1619.html">publicly fretted</a> whether inadequate precautionary regulation might place them in the position in which they found themselves last week, where they might feel they have no choice.</p>
   <p>To be clear, I think that Treasury, the Fed, and FDIC have done the right thing here. Once upon a time, the rationale for limited deposit insurance was that large depositors, whether rich individuals or big businesses, should monitor the operations of the banks they entrust with their money. Bankers who took unsound risks would face market discipline, losing the major depositors without whom they have little capital to risk.</p>
   <p>But in practice, this just doesn't work. Even regulators, who are highly trained specialists with privileged access to internal bank data, struggle to evaluate the soundness of modern banks. A midsized business that keeps $1M in the account from which it has to make payroll each month has zero real ability to keep honest a profession deeply schooled in the financial dark arts. If we insist that uninsured depositors take losses when their bank fails, the outcome won't be better disciplined banks, but a run to the banks that are hardest of all to discipline, the ones widely understood to be "too-big-to-fail". Despite tonight's walkback by regulators, the chaotic resolution of SVB may have already made that very bad result inevitable.</p>
   <p>What I do take issue with is Treasury/Fed/FDIC's claim that "no losses will be borne by the taxpayer" as they make uninsured depositors whole. Not to put too fine a point on it, that's bullshit. It's a particular strain of bullshit that has grown both common and destructive in the policymaking community.</p>
   <p>Treasury/Fed/FDIC say no losses will be borne by the taxpayer because they will levy a "a special assessment on banks, as required by law" to recover FDIC's losses. But who, pray, will pay for that "special assessment on banks"? It is not an assessment on the personal wealth of bank managers or shareholders. Some bank managers are billionaires, but they will pay no more of this "special assessment" than you or I. What will happen is <em>all deposits</em> will become effectively mutually insured by the industry as a whole. Every bank's costs — whether paid up-front as explicit FDIC deposit insurance premiums or paid on the backside as "special assessments" — will increase. Banks will have to recover this new cost from customers, in higher fees, higher lending rates, or lower deposit rates.</p>
   <p>Sure, there will not formally be a new tax to cover these costs. But in substance, the tax-paying public will experience higher expenses or foregone income. This habit of declaring "no new taxes" in form, while tacitly imposing taxes in substance, deprives the public of any capacity to design the tax, to shape its incidence, and to hold accountable those who provoke the costs the tax must recover.</p>
   <p>This is not the only case where policymakers launder taxes through what are ostensibly "private insurance premiums". Health care is riddled with this tactic. Whenever policymakers cap the "out-of-pocket cost" for a drug or medical procedure without also capping the cost billed to insurance companies, they are simply socializing whatever cost the billers impose via a "tax" that gets embedded all of our monthly premium payments. Whether any particular medical cost should be "socialized" or concentrated on the recipient of the service can be a subject of heated debate. (I'm on the side that says most medical costs should be socialized.) But regardless, we need to manage the cost we pay <em>in aggregate</em> for medical services, however we divide the hit. Capping out-of-pocket costs but not capping costs billed to insurers may perversely lead to <em>increases</em> in aggregate cost, as larger costs spread over the whole insurance base escape the outrage and scrutiny that concentrated costs provoke.</p>
   <p>It's better when we impose costs the public will have to bear as overt, explicit taxes than to let policymakers impose costs through private intermediaries then pretend "no losses will be borne by the taxpayer".</p>
   <p>One way or another, the public, or some part of it, will have to bear the cost of unlimited deposit insurance. The clearer it is that you and I and all of us are on the hook whenever any bank's hunger for yield leaves any deposit unbacked, the more likely we are to adopt actually sensible policy, like disentangling the deposits and payments system entirely from private risk investment.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>In my post on how why <a href="(##right-wing-higher-ed)">higher education is shockingly right-wing</a>, some libertarian commentators didn't like this:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>If "left" and "right" have any meaning at all, "right" describes a worldview under which civilized society depends upon legitimate hierarchy, and a key object of politics is properly defining and protecting that hierarchy.</p>
    <p>"Left", on the other hand, is animated by antipathy to hierarchy, by an egalitarianism of dignity. While left-wing movements recognize that effective institutions must place people in different roles — sometimes hierarchical, sometimes associated with unequal rewards — these are contingent, often problematic, overlays upon a foundational assertion that every human being has equal dignity and equal claim to the fundamental goods of human life.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>That, dear reader, is about the best and most concise explanation of left and right as you are ever going to get.</p>
   <p>But my libertarian friends hate it! Here's <a href="https://www.timworstall.com/2023/03/so-let-us-take-interfluidity-seriously-for-a-moment/">Tim Worstall</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Therefore markets – and free markets more especially – are not a right wing idea. For the entire point about the free in free markets is that absolutely anyone gets to try overturning that hierarchy. And, often enough, succeeds. Apple fucked over AT&amp;T rather nicely, Whitney’s cotton gin entirely shafted the linen and wool weavers, Aldi and Lidl cost Sainsbury’s shareholders billion upon billion.</p>
    <p>Which means that the left embraces markets as those hierarchy overturning engines that they are. Right?</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Ah, Tim. Markets are not just ideas. They are actual practices and institutions, which occur in the context of real societies and lived circumstances.</p>
   <p>Free markets were indeed a left-wing practice, several hundred years ago, when an ascendant bourgeoisie, bound only by the spontaneous organization of market logics, overturned the feudal hierarchies that had dominated Europe until then.</p>
   <p>Markets can be anti-hierarchy, and when they are, yes, they are on the left! "Classical liberals" used to be at war with the traditional right, remember?</p>
   <p>But what if, today, we talk about Marin County.</p>
   <p>Marin County, for those who don't know, is an exclave of San Francisco. It's the spit of land immediately across the Golden Gate Bridge from the city proper. It is breathtakingly beautiful. Its towns — places like <a href="https://www.sausalito.gov/">Sausalito</a>, <a href="https://www.cityofmillvalley.org/">Mill Valley</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larkspur,_California">Larkspur</a>, <a href="https://www.townofsananselmo.org/">San Anselmo</a>, <a href="https://www.townoffairfax.org/">Fairfax</a>, and <a href="https://www.townoftiburon.org/">Tiburon</a> — are contemporary paradises: safe, culturally lively, brimming with small-town charm but only a short drive from the big city.</p>
   <p>And Marin County is impeccably progressive! Everywhere you go, you will see the signs:</p>

You'll have to take my word, dear reader, as someone who really enjoys Marin County and has spent a lot of time there, that signs of this sort are in fact common.</em></p>
    <hr>
   </div>
   <p>Perhaps Tim and I would agree that there's something a bit hypocritical in all this progressivism. Everyone really is welcome in Marin! (Well, not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolinas,_California">Bolinas</a>, that's a different story.)</p>
   <p>Everyone is welcome, but a modest home will cost you a couple of million dollars. Those charming towns are incredibly segregated, racially and economically.</p>
   <p>The residents of Marin, like university professors, are perfectly sincere in their progressivism, as far as it goes. Yet, the residents of Marin assiduously defend exclusive access to extraordinarily desirable places to live without erecting a single physical gate. All they need is the housing market, under land-use rules that serve both to preserve the very real charm of their communities and to keep housing scarce.</p>
   <p>Perhaps that's not the market Tim would prefer! But it is the market we actually have.</p>
   <p>Matt Yglesias sometimes <a href="https://tinyletter.com/mattyglesias/letters/what-s-driving-me-is-driving-you">describes</a> his YIMBY preferences with respect to land use as Latin-America-style land reform. And he has a point! If Marin housing markets were made "free" in the way that Matt, and I suspect Tim, would prefer, then they might have a left-wing, anti-hierarchical valence!</p>
   <p>But that is not our world. In our real world, social hierarchies are <em>primarily inscribed via market processes</em>.</p>
   <p><a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7263.html">Quoting myself</a> yet again (fucking narcissist):</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[W]hat it means to live in a stratified society, precisely what it means to live in a stratified society, is that there are objective correlates to position along dimensions that individuals and communities cannot themselves choose. There are positional dimensions whose importance is a social fact, not arbitrary, but real as social facts are, by virtue of their consequences. In such a society, positional goods with desirable correlates, inherently scarce and inelastically supplied, become extremely valuable. In some societies, those goods may be rationed by custom, or by heredity, by caste or race. But to the degree that a society is “liberal” and capitalist, they will be price-rationed, as they largely (but incompletely) are in our American society.</p>
    <p>In a stratified, liberal capitalist society, the ability to command market power, to charge a margin sufficiently above the cost of inputs to cover the purchase of positional goods, becomes the definition of caste.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>If libertarians restricted their support for markets to arrangements and circumstances when they are anti-hierarchical, well, then they would be of the left!</p>
   <p>But very obviously, they do not in practice do that.</p>
   <p>Libertarians share exactly the same pathology as university professors and the smiling residents of Marin County: They flatter themselves that they stand in opposition to vicious social hierarchy, and find true-enough narratives by which to spin their allegiances into support for equal dignity. But their actual practices, the institutions they inhabit and animate and from which they earn their succor, belie all that.</p>
   <p>Contemporary libertarians are, um, quite disproportionately winners under current market arrangements. And they assiduously support those arrangements. They do not, for example, condition their support of markets on the rigor of actual competition, so that economic rents don't accumulate. Libertarians are not like a certain stripe of socialist, whining that socialism has never really been tried. Libertarians say that capitalism has been tried, and it works great.</p>
   <p>But under actually existing capitalism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew effects</a> rule the day. Markets may be notionally "free", but past winners (humans, not just firms) have tremendous advantage. Certain classes of people understand that market arrangements are likely to continue to deliver <em>to them</em> security and abundance, but will sadly deliver those goods less adequately to other groups whose ongoing misfortune, despite occasional bootstrap stories, we can pretty well predict.</p>
   <p>Markets, under these circumstances, become a locus of hierarchy, rather than a challenge to it.</p>
   <p>Which is why, despite protestations about loving freedom and encouragements to individual pluck, contemporary libertarians quite correctly identify as of the right.</p>

 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p><a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/james-madisons-vision-of-pluralism/">David French</a> argues we can "dilute the disruptive power of faction by allowing factions to bloom."</p>
   <p>He commends to us James Madison, writing <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493273">Federalist No. 10</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government...renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other...</p>
    <p>The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>The logic is, in principle, very appealing. When there is a wide diversity of factions, no single group can command a majority and do mischief. Majorities will have to be cobbled together across factional and party lines, echo chambers of parochial interest will have to be broken by compromise. Something like a general interest that transcends in-group loyalties will have to emerge in order to pass legislation.</p>
   <p>When Madison wrote, he was trying to build support for binding the American states into a new Union. He was eager to claim that a larger and more diverse polity will yield a higher, not lower, quality of government.</p>
   <p>(In other words, James Madison was the first "diversity is our strength" guy. Eat that my <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html">fascist</a> friends.)</p>
   <p>I am, um, constitutionally sympathetic to these ideas. But as the Union has evolved, two developments have badly undermined them.</p>
   <p>The first is technology. In a world of near-instant interconnection across any distance, it is a several-times-a-daily occurrence for "factious leaders" to spread very general conflagrations.</p>
   <p>In 1787, what would become the inaugural 13 states amounted to a vast polity, full of disparate places whose particular passions might easily swallowed by distance. In 2023, our 50 discontinuous states are just one cramped corner of the "global village". The effect of contemporary communications technologies has been to magnify systematic signals while averaging away idiosyncratic local diversity as though it were only noise. Relative to the range of flames that might be kindled by factious leaders, the extent of the proposed Union was large in Madison's day. Now our much larger Union is a one crowded forest in a bone dry summer, eager for the tiniest spark.</p>
   <p>The effects of technology may be hard to remedy. But the second problem is entirely self-inflicted.</p>
   <p>Madison counseled that factions should be small and many. But our single-winner, first-past-the-post voting system <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">exerts a social gravity</a> that pulls us into two, gigantic factions of similar size.</p>
   <p>Madison's Constitution doesn't specify a voting system, so this one isn't on him. But I really wish prominent modern-day admirers of Madison — like David French! — would be a bit more specific and constructive when offering paeans to dilution of faction. If we want multiple factions, we understand how to design voting systems that encourage and support that, rather than the voting system we have, which punishes any divergence from the two major parties.</p>
   <p>For legislatures, we could adopt any of the many voting systems that tend towards proportional representation, including</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">mixed-member proportional</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single-transferable vote</a>, or</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation">traditional party list</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Alternatively, we could really honor Madison's ghost and reprise our 1780s-era verve by jumping straight to something innovative, like</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1-1-1984-Choosing-Representatives-by-Lottery-Voting-Amar/6fd70eabac758800771f8baf880e7064cf361aa3?p2df">random ballot</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9069.html">mass representative democracy</a>, or</li>
    <li><a href="https://equalitybylot.com/">sortition</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>For positions that are inherently single-winner (like Mayor, Governor, or President), we could adopt systems like</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>that do not punish "minor" parties as spoilers.</p>
   <p><a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/">Ranked-choice voting</a> is another popular choice. I'm not a huge fan, but it's better than our terrible <em>status quo</em>!</p>
   <p>If you think democracy would work better with a more pluralistic ecosystem of factions, it's no good just to endorse and exhort. We are stuck in an equilibrium with two uber-factions, and we perfectly well understand why. If you mean to remedy that, <em>please specifically advocate voting system reform!</em></p>

   <p><em>After I ranted this to my friend <a href="https://wealtheconomics.substack.com/">Steve Roth</a>, he suggested I write it up. In substance, it's a retread of my <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5149.html">welfare economics series</a>, especially the second installment, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5212.html">Perils of Potential Pareto</a>.</em></p>
   <p><em>That series is the best economics writing I've ever done! But this is shorter and more ranty.</em></p>
   <ul>
    <li><p>In the beginning, there were they were just Benthamites. The greatest good for the greatest number, all of that. But they were always ambitious fucks. It was never enough for them to have a view, their view had to be writ, had to be <em>science</em>. You can <em>claim</em> that this or that action produces the greatest good for the greatest number, but how do you measure it? How do you prove it? Suppose you with the same resources you can feed ten people or entertain a thousand. Feeding a hungry person is a greater good, perhaps, than entertaining a fat one, but how much greater? Is it only 90 times the greater good, in which case the resources should go straight to Broadway, or 101 times the greater good, in which case the soup kitchen should get it? Benthamites could opine, but they could not <em>measure</em>. They had no means by which to persuasively contradict cretins who would make the opposite call.</p></li>
    <li><p>So, they declared economics an <em>empirical</em> science. "Henceforth," they shouted, about a century ago, "we shall base our conclusions only upon what we can (at least in principle) measure!" <em>Utility</em>, the phlogisten of the Benthamite creed, the hypothetical substance of good that was to be maximized across a population, was recast as "ordinal". We cannot know whether one hungry person's meal is worth more or less than 100 feted people's entertainment. But we can know that the hungry person, given a choice, will choose the meal over the musical. We can order and rank the value of goods to an individual, even if we can't measure the distance or difference between them, or make comparisons across different people. And, thanks to our man <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto</a>, we can offer a <em>scientific</em>, <em>empirical</em>, can't-dispute-this-motherfucker account of the good. If some action or policy will make <em>at least one person</em> better off (i.e. they would choose their new circumstance over their old), and make <em>no other people worse off</em> that, that, is indisputable an improvement. Here is a criterion that involves only observable (at least "in principle") rankings, and that requires no comparisons of unmeasurable welfare across different people! Hurrah! Those cretins have to listen to us now.</p></li>
    <li><p>Only. At the level of public policy, where economists aspire to rule (for the betterment of all, of course), there are almost no actions that meet the Pareto criterion. If you want to build a new public park for free, there is always some motherfucker who <em>loves</em> the wild shrubbery already there and <em>hates</em> the idea that loud, laughing children might interrupt his afternoon idyll. If (as economists always did) you want to open the borders to trade, there is always someone who will be put out of work by cheaper imports. The Pareto criterion was arguably <em>scientific</em>, but, as John Hicks famously <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2225023">put it</a>, this "economic positivism might easily become an excuse for the shirking of live issues, very conducive to the euthanasia of our science." And without our science, all that will be left are the cretins.</p></li>
    <li><p>So, Hicks, along with <a href="https://www.hujingbei.net/upload/2007_11/07110714361173.pdf">Nicholas Kaldor</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1907054">Harold Hotelling</a> came up with a workaround. Render unto the cretin the things which are the cretin's, but unto the economist the things which are the economist's. The economist cannot make claims about who should get what, the ten hungry people or the thousand fat circus-goers. That is a judgment of <em>values</em>. It is beyond science, so must be left to the cretins and their <em>politics</em>. However, we can observe whether some action would create a situation where <em>if</em> you taxed some of the people who would very much prefer the new situation <em>and</em> gave the proceeds to the people who would otherwise be grumpy about it, then <em>everyone</em> would prefer (or at worst be indifferent) to the new reality. If economists <em>require</em> the cretins — err, politicians — to actually perform this redistribution in order for it to be scored "efficient", then it is just the Pareto criterion. But, of course, economists knew very well that politicians would not in fact usually redistribute to make real some hypothetical Kumbaya. So they washed their hands of it. If everyone <em>could have been made</em> better, or at least no worse off, by an action <em>if some redistribution had occured</em>, then clearly the action itself "makes the pie bigger". We can score it as <em>scientifically</em> more efficient. That the cretins are unwilling to do the distribution? Hey, that's a values question, not our problem. Economists again could don the authority of science to tell us all what must be done. NAFTA is <em>efficient</em>! You don't understand arithmetic if you disagree.</p></li>
    <li><p>But oh no! It turns out (curse the name of <a href="https://www.hujingbei.net/upload/2007_11/07110714376633.pdf">Tibor de Scitovsky</a>!) this criterion of <em>potential</em> Pareto improvement is not an ordering. There are actions where, if we were to perform the action, the "winners" could compensate the "losers", and they would all be better off. But if we do not <em>actually</em> compensate the losers, <em>reversing the same action</em> and letting the initial losers compensate the undoing of the winners might <em>also</em> make everybody better off! (For a detailed treatment of this, follow the pictures <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5212.html">here</a>.) It is <em>incoherent</em> to declare something an efficiency improvement and then declare its reversal an efficiency improvement, but that is the <em>cul de sac</em> our poor scientists had backed themselves into. To this very day, economists do not have a practical criterion by which to declare an action or policy authoritatively "efficient", should cretins have the temerity to disagree. (There is the Pareto criterion, of course, in theory.)</p></li>
    <li><p>To really twist the knife, one economist examined the cycles Scitovsky had discovered and concluded this problem was very general. In a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2023/03/06/P41.pdf">Rand Corporation note</a> that was the foundation of a celebrated, seminal result, this economist acknowledged, "the compensation principal does not provide a true ordering of social decisions. It is the purpose of this note to show that this phenomenon is very general."</p></li>
    <li><p>That economist was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</a>, and if you've taken any economics at all, you've probably learned about the result that emerged from the Rand note. It is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem">Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</a>. But when you learned about that result, I bet you didn't learn that its original object was the <em>impossibility</em> of authoritative technocracy. Social actions cannot in general be ranked under the ordinal utility constraint economists impose upon themselves. Instead, you learned that it was about the impossibility of a good <em>voting system</em>, if we impose the constraints economists invented for themselves upon how we conceive of voting systems!</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>In other words, after struggling for decades to come up with a basis to make authoritative claims beyond politics, the economics profession realized by about 1950 that, at least on the terms they had prescribed for themselves, it was impossible. They had no criterion, and could have no criterion, by which they could elevate their conclusions as "scientific" and above the fray. What was to be done? Well, we know what they did.</p>
   <p>They took the weapon they invented, this theorem that damned their own authority, and they pointed it at the rest of us. They stopped talking about the impossibility of ranking social actions, but loudly proclaimed their theorem foreclosed the possibility of coherent democratic choice. If someone must be silenced by this discovery, it would not be <em>our profession</em>, it will be the cretins, the quarrelsome public with its crass politics.</p>
   <p>Our voting systems as we actually understand them are not, in fact, touched by the impossibility theorem, because we generally conceive of votes in <em>cardinal</em> rather than <em>ordinal</em> terms. Economists forbid themselves interpersonal comparisons, but in politics we have no trouble asserting that <em>my vote expresses a preference of the same weight as yours</em>. What economists foreswore because they could not measure, in politics we impose as an axiom on normative grounds.</p>
   <p>We are taught that Arrow's theorem condemns democracy when in fact it condemns economic technocracy. That doesn't mean voting systems <em>can</em> be made perfect: It remains true that no voting system meets all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_criteria">many, sometimes conflicting, criteria</a> we might desire of one. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard%27s_theorem">no deterministic voting system is immune</a> from strategic voting when there are more than two candidates. (We should consider <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7043.html">stochastic voting systems!</a>)</p>
   <p>Still, I find it breathtaking. This very result that economists understood perfectly well meant they had no sound basis for judging social action with authority beyond other approaches, they (we?) marketed as damning the other approaches.</p>
   <p>Economists are such scoundrels.</p>
