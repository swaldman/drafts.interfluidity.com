    </div>
    <p>I want to offer a straightforward point that a lot of economic controversializing should better take into account.</p>
    <p><strong>Over long periods of time, you cannot treat changes in measured "real purchasing power" as equivalent to changes in economic welfare.</strong></p>
    <p>This is confusing, because over short periods of time, you can and should! Change in real purchasing power is what you want to look at, when evaluating growth on a year to year basis.</p>
    <p>But there are slippages in the measure, so that as years accumulate into decades, comparisons become effectively meaningless.</p>
    <p>Let's talk about some of those slippages.</p>

    </ol>
    <p>We end with a <a href="#short_conclusion">short conclusion</a>.</p>
    <p><a name="1_purchasing_power_is_distinct_from_welfare" href=""></a><strong>1. Purchasing power is distinct from welfare, in a manner time varying</strong></p>
    <p>The object of the economy is not dollars and cents, not goods and services. If we built a paperclip maximizer and the paperclip maximizer consumed us all but produced paperclips in quantities such that they would (well would have) sold for ten times current GDP at their final price, that wouldn't actually count as growth.</p>
    <p>The object of economics is welfare. We are trying organize production and distribution of goods and services in whatever manner would make human beings "better off".</p>
    <p>"Better off" is inherently a normative question. Human welfare <em>per se</em> is not observable. Economics, with its pretensions toward being a "science" has <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5149.html">struggled with this for a century</a>.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, you have not said anything of interest if you have said people can buy more "stuff". It has to be the stuff they need, in a manner constitutive of well being.</p>
    <p>Economists model human behavior in terms of utility maximization. We claim, at any given time, people face a budget constraint. Within that budget constraint they put together a bundle of goods and services that maximizes their "utility". That utility then translates to "welfare", the unobservable, unscientific, well-being that we actually care about, but cannot quantitatively measure.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
     <a href="2025/11/12/real-purchasing-power-over-time-is-not-economic-welfare-over-time/welfare-diagram.png"><img src="2025/11/12/real-purchasing-power-over-time-is-not-economic-welfare-over-time/welfare-diagram.png" width="460"></a>
    </div>
    <p>Measures of real purchasing power can tell us something about Transition A, from a budget constraint to a bundle of goods and services. They can tell us nothing, unfortunately, about Transition B, from a bundle of goods and services to a person's welfare.</p>
    <p>Nothing suggests that the relationship between a bundle of goods and the welfare a person derives from it stays the same over time. Obviously it does not. A parent derives well-being from diapers in her consumption basket when her baby is 1 year old, but would not when her child is 11 years old.</p>
    <p>So the relationship between the <em>composition</em> of the consumption bundle and welfare is time varying. But so too can the relationship between the <em>value</em> of the consumption bundle and welfare. A twenty year old without children can thrive on a salary that would leave her immiserated when she has one-year-old twins and needs to fund the diapers and formula and child care.</p>
    <p><em><strong>The value of goods and services in welfare terms depends not only on their amount, but also upon the circumstances and obligations of their purchasers.</strong></em></p>
    <p>As individuals we all understand this, but as technocrats, we often fail to aggregate the insight.</p>
    <p>Transportation is a large fraction of what we spend money on, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251110213723/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm">roughly 10%</a> of the CPI-U consumption bundle if we include fuel costs. Consider a typical suburban commuter, who drives thirty minutes and twenty miles to and from work every day. A century ago, his doppelganger might have lived in an urban neighborhood, and walked or taken a streetcar to a workplace much closer to his home. The quantity of transportation our modern commuter purchases with his transportation budget, in terms of miles traveled, is absolutely extraordinary from his antecedent's perspective. Less than ten percent of his wages now purchase miles and miles of point-to-point, off-street-line transportion, which might easily have consumed his entire salary in 1925!</p>
    <p>In a certain sense, our modern commuter is a whole lot richer. Economic statisticians <em>accurately</em> measure his real consumption bundle as much, much larger than his predecessor's due to the collapse in cost, increase in speed and comfort, of transportation.</p>
    <p>But in another respect, our modern commuter is not richer at all. The world has changed. He no longer <em>has the option</em> of taking a job whose quality and pay would support his typical commuter lifestyle absent accepting an obligation to purchase all of those transportation miles. He <em>can</em> purchase a much larger bundle of goods and services than his predecessor could, but he also <em>has to</em> purchase a much larger bundle of goods and services just to live a life that will be welfare comparable.</p>
    <p>One can argue that, by the preferences revealed in America's historical suburbanization, our contemporary sprawling life is better than the more compact urban life that preceded it, and actually commuters are gaining welfare roughly in proportion to the vast expansion of transportation miles purchased. One can argue that America's suburbanization reflects political, economic, and social factors beyond individual preference, that are in any case locked into the built environment in ways now immune to personal choice, and that in fact suburban life is alienating and undesirable, as revealed by the very high cost of housing in compact urban areas that offer similar levels of safety and amenity under a pedestrian lifestyle. These are live questions! No purchasing power measure can answer them for us.</p>
    <p>We get to choose the bundle of goods and services we purchase from our income. Real purchasing power measures can tell us something about "how much" we can buy, although capturing a very heterogenous mix of goods and services in a single scalar value is always fraught.</p>
    <p>But real purchasing power measures do not tell us <em>anything</em> about the circumstances under which we purchase or deploy that bundle of goods and services, how much we <em>require</em> to stay above some waterline of welfare.</p>
    <p>And our requirements changes, quite radically. A person with the income, in real terms, of say a successful physician in 1925 would find themselves living in a mobile home park today, and incapable of practicing their profession, even presuming updated skills, for want of any ability to afford prerequisites to participation in terms of transportation, wardrobe, liability insurance, etc.</p>
    <p>At an individual level, we understand that an easy mistake a person can make is to let their cost structure increase faster than their means, even as their means increase. If your salary doubles, but you trade up for a more expensive car, a more expensive home, the kids in private schools, you may find yourself in a worse situation than you had been before your raise.</p>
    <p>But our economic measures don't consider that we might do this <em>as a society</em>, in ways that override the choices that we might have made individually. Most of us can't really opt out of the cost structures we've collectively established as typical, absent very radical breaks from society that would themselves negatively affect our welfare. Even as our correctly measured, median-not-average real income increases, our actual choice set can grow worse.</p>
    <p><a name="2_only_the_most_quantitative" href=""></a><strong>2. Only the most quantifiable aspects of changes in quality are captured in inflation measures</strong></p>
    <p>Inflation is not correctly measured. In saying that, I cast no shade on the fine econometricians at BLS, who do (and I hope will be permitted to continue to do) great work.</p>
    <p>But when constructing measures of the price level, if we fail to take into account adjustments in quality, we'll get things very wrong. BLS <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/quality-adjustment/">does adjust for quality</a>! But they can only do so on characteristics that can be straightforwardly quantified, and their relationship to price modeled. Plus, there are lots of characteristics that plainly affect the quality of our consumption of a good or service that would, for a variety of reasons, be controversial to incorporate into a price measure, and so aren't.</p>
    <p>Suppose we faced a new national crime wave that led to a broad-based increase in ones risk of getting mugged or ones house burgled, a similar increase basically everywhere. For all of us, then, the value in real terms of our housing will have declined. Nearby crime is definitely a component of the lived quality of housing!</p>
    <p>In theory one could try to adjust for this. To hold welfare roughly constant, a person living in what was once a modest crime neighborhood but is now very dangerous could move to a comparable home in what was once a practically crime-free neighborhood but now experiences modest crime. The difference in price between these two otherwise comparable homes would be a measure of how much the change in crime rate had impaired the value of the original home, even though observed home prices might not change much, since since the relative rankings of safety have not changed and everybody still has to live somewhere.</p>
    <p>Safety is a big part of what we pay a premium for when choosing a home. The national crime wave makes us all poorer, in terms of qualities of housing we actually pay for. From a conceptual standpoint, if aggregate prices are unchanged, we should treat that as housing inflation. You have to pay more to get the same safety-adjusted home.</p>
    <p>But we don't do that. Our thought experiment about how we might quantify the impairment depends upon accurate comparables that would be difficult for a statistical agency to put together. We don't think crime rates are measured very well or consistently across localities.</p>
    <p>Crime obviously and profoundly affects the real value of housing services we purchase. Home prices obviously depend, quite a lot, on nearby criminality. But we exclude it from the quality adjustment exercise, and we're unlikely to do anything about that.</p>
    <p>It's worth noting, this goes both ways! For the most part, the past few decades have been a tale of <em>decreasing</em> average criminality, despite a post-COVID bump. That has amounted to a large <em>increase</em> in the quality of American housing. It's been a source of <em>overstating</em> inflation.</p>
    <p>The point, however, is that aspects of the quality of goods and services unaccounted for by statistical agencies introduce noise, error, into our measures. Over short periods of time this error is likely to be small, but unless we assume without evidence the positive and negative omissions cancel, we should expect our mismeasurement to accumulate and grow over time. Comparisons, then, of "real" purchasing power become more and more surreal, the longer the interval over which they are compared.</p>
    <p><a name="3_inflation_measures_abstract" href=""></a><strong>3. Inflation measures abstract away the bundling of goods and services</strong></p>
    <p>Aspects of housing quality that we can and do adjust for include measurables like square footage. If, over a decade, observed home prices rise by 30%, but the size of the typical home sold also increases by 30%, should that count as home inflation at all? Mostly it doesn't, because BLS adjusts for home sizes. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>But housing is not in fact a good one buys by the square foot. When one buys a house, or rents an apartment, one must buy or rent all of its square feet. And the square footage of homes available is correlated to other characteristics, like recency of construction, quality of school, nearby crime rate, etc.</p>
    <p>A stupid point widely made in the punditocracy is that, if one wanted to live like a middle-class 1950s family on a single middle-class wage, one absolutely could, if one bought that same 1950s home with its 1950s square footage. But one would not actually be buying the same home at all, because the amenities that are the primary source of value for most homes is correlated with the affluence of ones neighbors. The small single-family home you could still buy at 1950s prices relative to a single middle-class wage earners' wages is very likely in a neighborhood with not-so-great schools, dollar stores rather than a Safeway, some issues with crime.</p>
    <p>Suppose a young couple, two incomes but not huge incomes, wants to buy a home in a new neighborhood with great schools. They could afford to buy in the neighborhood the thousand square feet that was typical of a single family home in the 1950s, at the current going rate per square foot. Unfortunately, our couple would likely find that there are no homes smaller than 2000 square feet in an upscale new single family home development.</p>
    <p>Our real purchasing power measures presume that they could buy such a home. But in practice, they have to buy twice the home they would have preferred in order to obtain the other goods bundled with housing. They are significantly poorer than their headline CPI adjusted wage suggests, because the methodologies behind inflation indices assume purchasers can independently set the quantities of goods purchased over a continual range, and often that they can substitute at will.</p>
    <p>In an unequal and class stratified societies, it is often the case that a few choices — in what kind of home one lives and near whom, what means of transportation you employ — segments whole classes of typical consumption bundles, in ways that sometimes seem perverse. For example, in the US, one can eat very cheaply if one stocks up on bulk goods from Costco. But to do so, one wants to live not so far from a Costco, have something like an SUV, have storage for bulk and also refrigerated goods, have financial liquidity one can afford to tie up in inventory. The low cost of bulk Costco purchases is correctly factored into the average that forms CPI grocery prices, but is inaccessible in practice to people who've selected (through lower cost housing and transportation) into a different consumption bundle.</p>
    <p>Again, over short periods of time, the bundles are what they are, they remain pretty constant so measured <em>changes</em> in the price level effectively control for this.</p>
    <p>But over longer periods of time, the whole structure of these bundles shift around, introducing error into comparisons of "real purchasing power".</p>
    <p><a name="4_changes_in_inequality_of_quality" href=""></a><strong>4. Changes in inequality of quality are overlooked</strong></p>
    <p>Charles Murray, whatever else one might have to say about him, wrote a good book in "<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/119020/coming-apart-by-charles-murray/">Coming Apart</a>". Among other observations, Murray pointed out that American success was increasingly concentrating into "super zips". A few concentrated geographies were becoming enclaves of the well-to-do, while the rest of the country increasingly languished.</p>
    <p>Let's consider how that dynamic might affect inflation and therefore "real purchasing power" measures, versus how it might affect welfare.</p>
    <p>Everyone must be housed, and to a first approximation, the housing stock of the country matches the number of households. Houses are a game of musical chairs: Absent a serious surplus — which is very far from our problem — roughly all the houses will be occupied. (Yes, second homes exist, and some homes fall into disused vacancy, but these categories are a small fraction, and if anything they exacerbate the dynamic we'll describe.)</p>
    <p>So, if a small fraction of these houses, for whatever reason, become much more desirable than the rest, their prices will be bid up. However, there is no reason to think that the <em>average</em> price of housing will increase. The purchasing power devoted to paying up for housing in the "super zips" is purchasing power no longer directed to housing elsewhere. If we hold <em>aggregate</em> housing budget constant the effect would be home prices in the desirable areas would spike, while housing prices in the rest of the country would fall (only a bit, since the rest of the country is much larger, has many times more homes, than the super zips) so that the <em>average</em> cost of housing remains unchanged.</p>
    <p>We don't in fact observe a constant cost of housing, because in practice, the aggregate housing budget is not held constant. Soaring top inequality helps ensure prices of the most desirable homes are continually bid upward. Our financial system lends purchasing power to home buyers at an increasing rate, a rate that for the past four decades has exceeded the rate of inflation. Housing prices in aggregate rise.</p>
    <p>But the effect we've described still holds: Housing prices in "super zips" rise much faster than elsewhere, housing prices elsewhere increase more slowly, as so much of the aggregate bid on housing flows to premium enclaves. An average ends up in our inflation index.</p>
    <p>If we hold the quality of housing constant, this distributional oddity translates to an <em>increase</em> in most homebuyers purchasing power. Rich peoples' odd fetish with "super zips" means that housing is cheaper everywhere else for everyone else than otherwise it would have been. Noah Smith famously made this point with his "<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/yuppie-fishtanks-yimbyism-explained">yuppy fishtank</a>" metaphor. Normal people should delight as yuppies and tech bros and other people with more money than sense waste their housing dollars in a few overpriced districts. It prevents the rest of us from having to compete with their vast pocketbooks if we want a bit of space.</p>
    <p>However, as Murray observed, we don't in practice hold the quality of housing constant. The quality of housing is largely a function of who your neighbors are and how that shapes the parks, schools, commercial amenities, social and employment opportunities that surround you. Well-to-do people are not in fact concentrating themselves into these few districts because they are fucking weirdoes who like to be fucking weirdoes. They are doing so because there is a network effect. The more people with resources you put together in a tight geography, the more likely it's going to be a safe, appealing place to live with good schools and good jobs. When those resources withdraw themselves from the rest of the country to enjoy this network effect, the rest of the country suffers a loss in quality. Safeways get replaced by Whole Foods on one side of the divide, by Dollar Trees on the other.</p>
    <p>Housing price increases come to have a bimodal distribution, a high rate for coveted geographies, a lower rate everywhere else. The measured average rate of housing inflation is a correct average, but matches lived experience on neither side of the divide. The median household is lilely to experience a lower rate of housing price increases than is included in the measure.</p>
    <p>However, before we pronounce on the correctness of the measure for any household, we also have to adjust for quality. It could be the case that the relative decline in quality of non-super-zip areas exactly matches the slower-than-average price appreciation, so the inflation measure is in fact correct for the median household!</p>
    <p>But it could also be the case that the decline in quality of households in less coveted locales <em>more than offsets</em> the lower-than-average rate of home price increases, in which case headline real purchasing power for the median household would be overstated.</p>
    <p>The same is true for wealthy areas. It could be that the increase in quality due to rich-people network effects exactly matches the higher-than-average rate of price increase, and so the headline inflation measure is correct for these households. It could be that rich people getting together and sharing lattes and nice parks is so awesome that the quality difference outpaces the above average home price appreciation, and so measured inflation is overstated for these regions.</p>
    <p>It could also be the case that there are diminishing returns to rich-people network effects, so that over time the quality increase fails to match the high rate of home price appreciation, so true housing inflation is higher than the headline measure.</p>
    <p>Note that there is no necessary relationship between quality changes in the two regions. Nothing compels a loss in quality in less coveted geographies to be in any sense "equal to" a gain in quality in the special places. It could be that rich people leaving affects the quality of life in less pricey places not at all, so rich people self-segregating amounts to a positive sum change, they enjoy nicer parks at no cost to anyone. It could, however, be the case that better-resourced people segregating away has a very large negative effect on the places they abandon, which more than offsets, in aggregate terms, the benefits the wealthy enjoy in their enclaves. If this is the case, the dynamic could make us in aggregate much poorer, while our real median purchasing power measures remain entirely oblivious.</p>

     <a href="2025/11/12/real-purchasing-power-over-time-is-not-economic-welfare-over-time/Price_changes_in_US_1998-2018.jpg"><img src="2025/11/12/real-purchasing-power-over-time-is-not-economic-welfare-over-time/Price_changes_in_US_1998-2018.jpg" alt="Graph " width="500"></a>
    </div>
    <p>"Real" purchasing power is based on the average price of some bundle of goods, usually allowing for some degree of substitution between similar goods. Even while the average stays relatively stable, prices of the components of the bundle can vary widely. As the graph shows, some things have grown <em>much</em> more expensive, while others have grown <em>much</em> cheaper, even while the overall price level ("CPI for All Items" in the graph) changed less dramatically.</p>
    <p>Further, the composition of the bundle replicates what an <em>average</em> rather than <em>median purchaser</em> might buy, which has important distributional consequences.</p>
    <p>It's worth unpacking this a bit. In the econo-micro-blogosphere, there's a typical dialog that goes something like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p><strong>Apologist:</strong> <em>[posts graph like Stancil's at the top of this piece]</em></p>
     <p><strong>Agonist:</strong> You say that incomes have grown, but that's just because, like, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have gotten so rich.</p>
     <p><strong>Apologist:</strong> It's <em>median</em> income. Do you even know what a <em>median</em> is, ya fuckin' commie?</p>
     <p><em>[Suddenly in His Infinite Patience, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/besttrousers.bsky.social">Matt Darling</a> appears to explain what a median is.]</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"Apologist" is right that the income measure she has chosen is a median, and so is unaffected by Musk and Bezos' hypertrophied extraction.</p>
    <p>But there is a wrinkle! The very units of that measure are based on <em>average</em> purchasing habits, which mean they are skewed to the purchasing habits of the relatively rich who, unsuprisingly, spend a disproportionate share of the money spent buying consumer goods!</p>
    <p>(See <a href="https://www.crisesnotes.com/one-election-takeaway-voters-hate-temporary-safety-nets/">Nathan Tankus</a>, <a href="https://econwpa.ub.uni-muenchen.de/econ-wp/pe/papers/0110/0110001.pdf">Eduardo Ley</a>.)</p>
    <p>The less rich spend a greater much fraction of their wealth on necessities and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_good">inferior goods</a> than the wealthy do. A quick glance at the graph above confirms that prices have tended to increase quickly for the necessities that consume a large share of the median consumer's budget, while we've enjoyed outright deflation in more discretionary goods. So "median household real income" is overstated for the median consumer, because its <em>very units</em> are biased toward the experience of the better off.</p>
    <p>This bias would disappear if variability in the rate of price changes happened to be orthogonal to differences in the consumption bundle between the rich and less rich, but that is unlikely ever to be the case. Independence of variables in social affairs is the rare exception, not the rule.</p>
    <p>The direction of the bias could invert if high-budget-share necessity prices grow more slowly than the prices of discretionary goods. But for the past decades, the pattern of facts means that "median real household income" measures are overstated for the median household.</p>
    <p>The size of this bias will be related to the level of consumption inequality. We have interminable arguments over whether inequality is increasing or decreasing, and what kinds of inequality count. Under Biden, wage inequality <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31010/w31010.pdf">compressed for a while</a>, but comprehensive income inequality <a href="https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/125174/">tends to be driven</a> more by asset valuation changes, and home prices <a href="https://www.technologyasnature.com/2025/07/19/house-flying/">boomed</a>. Although the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rena-raha.bsky.social/post/3m475pdrq4s2k">recent claim</a> that the top 10% account for 50% of consumer spending is <a href="https://x.com/LevyAntoine/status/1985127826207772920">almost certainly overstated</a>, consumption inequality in the US is high, and has likely been growing over the last few decades. If consumption inequality increases while inflation hits necessities more than discretionary items, both trends will reinforce one another in causing measures of "real median household income" to be overstated.</p>
    <p><a name="short_conclusion" href=""></a><strong>Short Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>Stancil <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/whstancil.bsky.social/post/3m5bv43lpbs2z">writes</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The American economy is much larger than a few decades ago and much of those gains (not enough! But a lot) have been spread across the income distribution. Economically speaking, you’d almost certainly rather live today than any prior time.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That's his point of view. It might be right! What we measure as GDP is, factually, larger than it ever has been.</p>
    <p>But any claim that things are "better" for the typical American is an opinion, one you can try to muster various sorts of evidence to support, but on which you can't pull rank — because <em>science</em>, <em>data</em> — and coronate as fact.</p>
    <p>A lot of people — yes, a lot of us, I number among them — disagree that these are materially the best of times in the good ol' US of A. There is evidence on our side too. Suicide rates have been <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide">on a consistent uptrend</a>. The political upheavals we've experienced might have other-than-material causes. But they do suggest that a lot of us might not perceive our circumstances as too wonderful if more of us want to kill ourselves and the public seems willing to risk burning it all down just for the possibility of some change.</p>
    <p>Whatever we are doing seems not to be conducive of welfare, and economics ultimately is the science of organizing production and consumption in the service of human welfare. If our measures say everything is awesome, we might hope for more discerning measures.</p>
    <p>I guess you can argue that things really are awesome and we are <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-end-of-history-and-the-last-man-francis-fukuyama/cab760a2adf2d8fa?ean=9780743284554&amp;next=t">last men</a>, blowing it all up out of ennui, because we are too comfortable. I'd gently suggest you are mistaken. From my perspective, if this is your view, you don't live in the world. In the world I inhabit, even the objectively affluent suffer astonishing levels of financial distress. Lots of people aren't objectively affluent, perceive themselves as losers in the richest country ever, do consider suicide. The <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7263.html">cost structure</a> of contemporary American life <a href="2023/06/04/quietly-expensive-desperation/index.html">pushes us all to become grifters</a>. Whether we succeed or fail, what is surely unaffordable is to <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5031.html">be good people</a>.</p>
    <p>Whichever side of this, or most, arguments you take — on this as on most social questions — what we can observe definitively in factual terms is unlikely to be dispositive.</p>
    <p>This is <a href="2025/08/20/the-whole-point-of-a-democracy/index.html">why we have democracy</a> in the first place. Ultimately human welfare is a matter of subjectivities. We require our subjectivities to be incorporated in the policymaking process if the polity is to thrive. You are a bad technocrat if you imagine you can substitute your technocratic measures for those subjectivities. Your job is to grope for a reconciliation between the objective constraints about which you may in fact be expert and the subjective outcomes that are ultimately policy's purpose.</p>
    <p>I'm happy to concede that most Americans can buy "more stuff" in some sense than ever before. The typical household can buy a lot more televisions. But it is perfectly possible — I think probable, I think obvious — that matching the stuff you can buy with the prequisites of a materially secure, comfortable life has become much harder for the typical person than it was even in the relatively recent past.</p>
    <p>Stancil — and you dear reader! — are free to disagree. I certainly will not claim that I can prove you factually wrong.</p>
    <p>I do think I can reject Stancil's assertion that "claims like 'there has been a generational stagnation of purchasing power'" are somehow a shibboleth of the progressive side of economic debates. Let's hear from <a href="https://roddreher.substack.com/p/what-i-saw-and-heard-in-washington">Rod Dreher</a>, a "post-liberal" on the Orbanist right, speaking with a young conservative:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>I asked one astute Zoomer what the Groypers actually wanted (meaning, what were their demands). He said, “They don’t have any. They just want to tear everything down.”</p>
     <p>Then he went on to explain in calm, rational detail why his generation is so utterly screwed. The problems are mostly economic and material, in his view (and this is something echoed by other conversations). They don’t have good career prospects, they’ll probably never be able to buy a home, many are heavily indebted with student loans that they were advised by authorities to take out, and the idea that they are likely to marry and start families seems increasingly remote.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If our economic miseries are only mass delusion, it is delusion more widespread than the progressives with whom Stancil so remarkably squabbles online.</p>

    <p>The Democratic Party should campaign and run on a single issue: Blowing up the two-party system.</p>
    <p>The Democratic Party, as presently constituted, cannot succeed under contemporary circumstances. The best thing it can do is become a fertile corpse from which more capable successors can grow. The party's infamous "fecklessness" is structural.</p>
    <p>To understand this, I recommend <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5363315">a recent paper by Tom Pepinsky</a>, which usefully distinguishes between states that <em>structure</em> or <em>referee</em> pluralistic conflict and states that purport to <em>express</em> an overriding collective will:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>[S]hould the state aggregate, channel, or otherwise structure political organization and contestation among the units of society, or should it express the popular will? In the former approach to the state, political institutions mediate conflict and channel popular demands by establishing formal and informal rules that define public and private spheres and structure political competition. Countermajoritarian institutions, for example, restrain the majority from enacting its preferences, and representative institutions organize the politics of lawmaking, policy advocacy, voting, and other forms of claims-making in ways that prevent disordered, disorganized, or extreme political demands from becoming law or policy.</p>
     <p>An alternative view of the state sees any such mediating institutions as an obstacle to the full expression of the popular will. In this approach, the appropriate function of the state is to express or manifest a collective will, rather than to direct or constrain that will.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The United States' electoral system, built on top of single-winner, first-past-the-post election <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">strongly encourages</a> the emergence of two and only two "major" political parties. Americans have generally conceived of these as necessarily "big tent" parties, each the product of fractious internal negotiations yielding broad coalitions which fully satisfy no one, but which represent — or at least better-represent than the other party — something like 50% of the electorate.</p>
    <p>There was broad consensus in the United States that role of government was to referee a pluralistic society. The major parties took on a kind of fractal, subsidiary role in the system, each refereeing contestation within its own half of the electorate.</p>
    <p>This consensus on the role of government has been shattered now, but asymmetrically. One of America's two major parties has reconceived itself as striving to realize a true collective will against obstacles imposed by internal enemies. Republicans now claim a "mandate" that cannot be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/opinion/trump-2024-election-maga.html">justified on quantitative electoral grounds</a>, but which they nevertheless proclaim represents the true and correct will of the American people. It is not yet clear, under Pepinsky's taxonomy, whether the new Republican Party will ultimately prove to be "populist" — channeling a popular will conceived as an aggregation of what individual citizens want, or "integralist" — organized to serve social categories and hierarchies conceived as prior to and overriding of individual caprices. (My take is the Republican Party sells itself, while it still must sell itself, as populist, but its leaders mean to rule on authoritarian integralist terms.)</p>
    <p>While the Republicans monomaniacally express a will they fabricate on behalf of "real Americans", the Democratic Party remains a referee of its very fractious coalition. It seems as if "we" have no core, no underlying principle, because "we" constituted as the Democratic Party do not in fact all share similar values. For example, social democrats (like me) and the still very neoliberal "centrists" agree that we want a pluralistic society under rule of law. But in fact we hope for very different outcomes, very different kinds of societies, to emerge under that rule of law.</p>
    <p>When that was also true of the Republican Party — when their religious conservatives and their neoliberals were locked in analogous internecine struggles — there was a kind of symmetry. Both of the two parties faced the same kind of handicap, and the electoral system could function giving factions across the two parties more or less equally compromised forms of representation.</p>
    <p>But the Republican Party is something different now. Its internal differences are overridden by shared allegiance to the person of Donald Trump. It is united by <a href="2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html">struggle against internal enemies</a>, a "far left" which those of us who allegedly constitute it perceive as farcical exaggeration, as caricature, but whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_theorem">social reality</a> lies not in representational accuracy, but in how it motivates and organizes the people who present it.</p>
    <p>Against this kind of party, the Democratic Party is a nullity. It can win elections sometimes, after the party which claims to express the collective will governs in ways that prove unpopular. But it subsists only in that party's negative space. A divided self-refereeing big-tent can exercise no real agency. It reacts. It must hope for and rely upon the other party's incompetence. Politics becomes a game played out between one clear protagonist and an inchoate cast of minor characters.</p>
    <p>The internal diversity of the everybody-but party is not, alas, that party's strength. Almost anything that would really excite one faction in the grab-bag party becomes a wedge issue alienating other factions. Those who identify with the populist or integralist or perhaps fascist party find themselves unified, excited, thrilled by their leaders' bold choices. Those who identify with the residual party find themselves constantly frustrated, betrayed, asked to embrace compromises that satisfy no one in the name of "strategy" that amounts to little more than holding onto our best shot if the other guy fucks up badly enough.</p>
    <p>This just isn't a winning hand. Even when the residual party wins elections, it disappoints by its compromised governance, rendering every reprieve fragile and temporary.</p>
    <p>Human affairs are not mere numbers games. Successful political struggle relies upon political passions. Perhaps a system in which nearly everyone's passions were frustrated or attenuated by the institutions of political contestation was once moderating, virtuous. Perhaps it was never virtuous, and that's why it failed.</p>
    <p>Regardless, it has failed. It is no longer on offer. We now require political parties that organize political communities with which people passionately identify, within which and on behalf of which people energetically act.</p>
    <p>The Republican Party is that. The Democratic Party cannot be that, not without alienating constituencies it requires in order to have any hope of victory. We can't all passionately identify as "Democrats", and share a common leadership, while that leadership necessarily sells out this group or that in the name of avoiding wedge issues and preserving the prospects of electoral incumbents we can't afford to lose. We would be more effective as distinct passionate communities who work in coalition, as strange bedfellows, on the pluralistic commitments we share without having to pretend we share views that in fact we do not on how a good society would be organized.</p>
    <p>But the factions of the Democratic Party cannot productively divorce so long as the electoral system overwhelmingly punishes defection from one of what must be only two structurally "major" political parties. The Democratic Party's monomaniacal challenge right now should be to insist that the House of Representatives is chosen by some form of proportional representation, and that inherently single-winner positions like Senator and President are chosen by <a href="2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">approval voting</a>.</p>
    <p>Opening up the electoral system would shatter both of the legacy major parties, not just the Democrats. The MAGA wing that now controls the Republican Party has cowed and silenced the rest of its coalition, but Republican electoral success still relies upon people who have misgivings, but who fear "the left" more, or who prioritize low taxes, or who just vote their cultural affinity. These people too could find homes and champions outside the ominous conformity enforced by Donald Trump.</p>
    <p>Most voters detest the two party system. Nearly all of us understand we are poorly represented by the choices we are offered. But we have been trained — correctly, in our current system! — that voting for a third-party amounts to childish self-harm, spoiling the prospects of the less awful major party, handing victory to the very worst or us.</p>
    <p>Once we educate the public about how and why seemingly technical changes to how we vote would in fact blow up the two-party system, electoral reform will become very popular, a great issue to run on. It's a promise we can deliver on if we win. You don't need a Constitutional amendment to make these changes. Just an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">act of Congress</a>. A President who vetoes these reforms would make himself very unpopular, and we'd just do it again in two years.</p>
    <p>To compete with a party that passionately expresses its (very ugly) version of a collective will, the rest of us will require political parties that can passionately channel our own collective aspirations. Forming and joining such parties doesn't mean giving up on the pluralistic society most of us want to inhabit and nurture. It simply means removing pluralistic contestation from the level of big-tent political parties, where it once accidentally found itself, into the institution of the United States Congress, where it Constitutionally belongs.</p>
    <p>The Democratic Party cannot win and govern as a party defined primarily as "not those bastards". It can't commit to a clear identity (Bernie-style populist social democrats? Warren-style technocrat social democrats? Obama/Clinton-style progressive neoliberals?) without catastrophically demoralizing a large fraction of its coalition.</p>
    <p>But the Democratic Party can organize a murder/suicide of both legacy political parties, and of America's two-party system. Sweeter fruit will grow from its fertile corpse.</p>

    <p>Last Friday, I held forth a bit on a very high-level story of the US macroeconomy, and Steve Roth suggested I write it up. So, here goes.</p>
    <p>I divide the postwar era into six not-quite-disjoint eras:</p>

    </ol>
    <h3><a href="#1-treaty-of-detroit-1950---early-1970s" id="1-treaty-of-detroit-1950---early-1970s" name="1-treaty-of-detroit-1950---early-1970s" class="anchorlink"></a>1. Treaty of Detroit (1950 - early 1970s)<a name="pocketbook-history-US-macro-regimes_section_1" href=""></a></h3>
    <p>Immediately postwar, we lived in a benign Keynesian technocracy. Aggregate supply was a function of accumulated fixed capital and continual productivity growth. Aggregate demand was a function of aggregate wages. Aggregate wages can be oversimplified as a conventional wage level times the size of the labor force.</p>
    <p>During this period, aggregate supply was growing faster than the labor force. This meant something close to full employment — at a full conventional wage — could be accommodated without putting pressure on the price level.</p>
    <p>Under these conditions, hydraulic Keynesian "fine tuning" could basically work. Technocrats could stabilize the price level and ensure full employment without provoking very difficult tradeoffs. Labor unions could insist on job security and wages that grew in real terms every year, to the vexation of the shareholding class, no doubt, but without creating macroeconomic difficulties.</p>
    <p>This is not to say all was well and perfect. Between 1950 and 1970, the US experienced three relatively mild recessions. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-rate-by-year-7253832">There was</a> a significant inflation related to the Korean War in 1950-1951 , and, famously, a smaller, "transient" inflation in the mid 1950s. But this was turbulence in a booming economy, not failure of an economic regime.</p>
    <p>By the late 1960s, there were adumbrations of what was soon to come. Inflation was picking up. The seeds of great misery were planted by Milton Friedman in a <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/88-301/phillips/friedman.pdf">1968 speech</a>, introducing to the world the idea of a "natural rate of unemployment" beyond which there must be accelerating inflation. The 1970s would fertilize that soil, and by the 1980s those seeds would yield weeds so robust we have still not entirely shaken them.</p>
    <h3><a href="#2-baby-boomers-inflation-1970s---early-1980s" id="2-baby-boomers-inflation-1970s---early-1980s" name="2-baby-boomers-inflation-1970s---early-1980s" class="anchorlink"></a>2. Baby boomers' inflation (1970s - early 1980s)<a name="pocketbook-history-US-macro-regimes_section_2" href=""></a></h3>
    <p>I've <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/4561.html">written this up</a> before, to some controversy at the time.</p>
    <p>The postwar baby boom was an unpinned grenade, nonchalantly waiting to blow up the prior period of macroeconomic stability.</p>
    <p>So long as the babies were babies, they were no problem. Sure, parents had to care for them, but since most working families had kids, the conventional standard of living included child-care costs. Workers on conventional wages didn't feel disadvataged or ill-done having to cover them. Society was arranged so that it was possible for conventional wage-earners to afford and raise children.</p>
    <p>But once the kids grew up, when they too became workers and wanted to contribute, that's when they became a problem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jne9t8sHpUc">Isn't it ironic.</a></p>
    <p>Labor productivity is a function, at any given moment, of <em>matching</em> labor to the existing stock of capital. The US economy was accustomed to, and able to, develop new fixed capital fast enough to match a certain rate of influx of new workers into the labor force.</p>
    <p>But the baby boom was a firehose that outstripped the pace at which the US could develop new fixed capital.</p>
    <p><a href="2025/09/25/a-pocketbook-history-of-postwar-us-macro-regimes/us-births-and-deaths.png"><img src="2025/09/25/a-pocketbook-history-of-postwar-us-macro-regimes/us-births-and-deaths.png" width="100%"></a></p>
    <p>Further, young women of the baby boom generation joined the labor force at higher rates than prior generations, and expected pay closer to conventional male-worker wages. The US labor force suddenly faced a challenge of employing <em>a lot</em> of new entrants, and employing them productively enough to meet pretty high wage expectations.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/files/CLF-10Y-GROWTH.png"><img src="https://www.interfluidity.com/files/CLF-10Y-GROWTH.png" width="100%"></a></p>
    <p>But this firehose of new workers, unmatched to capital, could not be employed at the level of productivity that had been typical previously. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis">1970s' infamous supply shocks</a> exascerbated the productivity challenge. Still, the kids expected to earn a conventional wage in real terms, meaning, in the jargon (and the pronouns) of the day, a wage on which a person could afford his own pad and wheels and live independently.</p>
    <p>An economist might predict that a sharp, sudden influx of workers that engendered a reduction of productivity of the marginal worker would lead to a decline in real wages. Or else to unemployment, if real wages are sticky or not permitted to decline.</p>
    <p>For many of the United States' unionized workers, real wages were not permitted to decline, as a matter of contract. But a very energetic and entitled generation of young people, which only a few years earlier had somewhat credibly threatened revolution, were not going to tolerate unemployment.</p>
    <p>Immovable object, irresistible force.</p>
    <p>Policymakers were in a pickle.</p>
    <p>Inflation was, if not exactly a solution, then a confusion that allowed the country to muddle through. The Great Inflation was miserable and unfair — it picked a lot of losers! — but precisely via its misery and unfairness, it helped address both the problem of unaffordable real wages and the problem of sustaining youth employment. In the unionized 1970s, some older workers were protected by <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/112814/how-does-cost-living-adjustment-cola-affect-my-salary.asp">COLA</a> clauses in their contracts, others were not. Those who were not, and who otherwise had little bargaining power in their jobs, were handed very large real wage cuts. Not by any boss or politician they could get mad at, but by an inhuman demon, a "natural market force", a thing that economists and newsmen called "inflation".</p>
    <p>By the end of the decade, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MyMM">real wage cuts</a> to the unlucky were sufficiently deep to create space to employ the cohort of younger workers at their non-negotiable pad-and-wheels wage floor.</p>
    <p>The net effect of the inflation was a real wage cut, on average. But it was concentrated among non-union, lower-bargaining power older workers, who were neither revolutionaries nor electorally organized, and so whose pain could be tolerated. It was also a redistribution from these workers to young new entrants, who were revolutionaries, or who might have been, had they not in this way been satisfied.</p>

Stumbling into the Great Moderation (1980s)<a name="pocketbook-history-US-macro-regimes_section_3" href=""></a></h3>
    <p>The poor tradeoffs under which the Great Inflation had been the best of a lot of bad choices traumatized policymakers. At the same time, Americans made the catastrophic error of electing Ronald Reagan, who represented aggrieved capital, and who even under the prior, benign, macro regime would have sought to crush workers for the benefit of shareholders.</p>
    <p>So crush workers for the benefit of shareholders they did!</p>
    <p>It's easy to explain why Reagan and his political supporters tore to shreds what vestiges remained of the Treaty of Detroit. They represented business owners, a faction contesting with other factions for a greater share of output, which they were sure they deserved. Nothing is more ordinary.</p>
    <p>But what's interesting is that well-meaning technocrats — and not only the ones bought off with lucrative sinecures — largely agreed that this was the right thing to do.</p>
    <p>The 1970s had exposed a tremendous <em>fragility</em> in US macro- and political economic arrangements. Our ability to manage the price level and ensure something like full employment had proven dangerously coupled to vicissitudes of the labor force. In oversimplified, overaggregated Keynesian terms, the marginal dollar of aggregate demand — the expenditures that determine the price level, that decide the inflation rate — came out of nominal wages. And that was a problem.</p>
    <p>While it is straightforward for policymakers to stimulate nominal wage <em>growth</em>, policymakers have no palatable tools to <em>reduce</em> nominal wages when there is an upward shock to the labor force or a downward shock to aggregate supply. In the United States (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/06/11/na061120-kurzarbeit-germanys-short-time-work-benefit">not everywhere!</a>), reductions in labor demand provoke <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6088.html">adjustments on the extrinsic rather than on the intrinsic margin</a>. That's ugly economist-speak, but all it means is that, as the wage pool dies up, people get fired rather than everyone keeping their jobs at lower pay. In the US, when demand is tightly coupled to wages, the only way to restrain demand is to put people out of work and provoke a recession.</p>
    <p>But then Reagan, for his own reasons, crushed the American labor movement. The <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W270RE1A156NBEA">wage share</a> of the economy had declined as inflation reduced real wages over the course of the 1970s. It continued to decline over the disinflationary 1980s, thanks to Reagan's labor-hostile administration.</p>
    <p>The American policy apparatus, whose job is to stabilize, almost automatically ensured that, when wage-financed demand faltered, alternative sources of demand would be stimulated to ensure the economy kept humming. The stock market boomed. Real estate boomed. That was "natural", you might say. As labor bargaining power declined, a greater share of revenues could be appropriated by their firm's residual claimants, shareholders. Wealthier people are real-estate buyers, and as more wealth flows to the rich, real-estate prices get bid.</p>
    <p>Then asset price booms tend to bring with them borrowing booms — from speculators seeking leverage, from families borrowing to afford increasingly expensive homes, from owners of appreciating assets seeking liquidity in order to spend some of their windfall.</p>
    <p>Policymakers quickly realized <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1256656346.shtml">they were in a much better place</a>. Before, the only way they could "fine-tune" economic activity downward was to reduce aggregate nominal wages, which would provoke unemployment, recession, political disquiet. But now the "marginal purchaser of a unit of CPI" was spending out of borrowings or capital income, rather than out of wages. Policymakers could downregulate these sources of demand much more painlessly. As before, policymakers would raise interest rates to prevent inflation. But now raising rates would exert their effect <em>before</em> very many people were thrown out of work, simply by reducing borrowing and blunting asset price growth.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>Economic policymakers had stumbled into "the Great Moderation", and they wanted to keep it. Although they hadn't predicted or engineered it, exactly, after the fact, they did understand how it worked. They had been cornered in the 1970s because their core policy objectives — full employment and inflation — were structurally in conflict, so long as the price level was very tightly coupled to nominal aggregate wages. By suppressing nominal aggregate wages and replacing the suppressed increment with borrowings and capital income, they decoupled employment from inflation. They could sustain "full employment" and modulate borrowings and capital income in order to achieve their policy objectives.</p>
    <p>Note the scare quotes around "full employment". Policymakers understood that if they were going to keep this great achievement, they had to prevent any upsurge in labor bargaining power that might render adjustments to borrowing and asset prices insufficient to the task of containing inflation.</p>
    <p>So they tended Milton Friedman's seeds. They redefined "full employment" to mean Friedman's "natural rate of unemployment" — or the much more technical-sounding NAIRU ("non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment"). They estimated it to be… <a href="https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/nairu-data-set">about</a> <a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/Workingpapers/PDF/wp1324.pdf">6%</a>! During the "Treaty of Detroit" era, 6% was a recessionary level of unemployment. By the early 1990s it had been recast not only as normal, but as a desirable, optimal.</p>
    <p>The Federal Reserve remade itself into a kind of financialized union buster. Its role was to watch, eagle-eyed, for any sign of "wage pressure", for any upward creep of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2942.html">unit labor costs</a>, and then threaten to bust up the economy if that strength was allowed to continue. Robust wages had cornered and embarrassed America's technocrats in the 1970s. That would not be permitted to happen again.</p>

Democratization of credit era (mid 1980s - 2008)<a name="pocketbook-history-US-macro-regimes_section_4" href=""></a></h3>
    <p>The real innovation of the Great Moderation, as I described it above, was to suppress wage income and replace it with financially-sourced cash such that "the 'marginal purchaser of a unit of CPI' was spending out of borrowings or capital income, rather than out of wages".</p>
    <p>This implies that, in some sense, a "typical" American lifestyle would no longer be affordable on wages alone. The prototypical purchaser of the CPI bundle earned wages, sure, but supplemented those wages with either capital income or borrowings. The typical wage earner would not be able to afford a typical level of consumption only out of wages.</p>
    <p>That sounds pretty bad! Then as now, most people are not wealthy enough to earn meaningful financial income.</p>
    <p>You need wealth to earn capital income. But you don't have to be rich to borrow. Anyone can do that, as long as they can find a willing lender.</p>
    <p>The Great Moderation macro regime might have been politically untenable, as the great bulk of the public would find their capacity to consume out of wages diminished relative to an average level of consumption set by the asset-owning rich.</p>
    <p>That's not what happened. Instead the broad public <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/WP9-Cyn-Fazz-ConsInequ.pdf">kept up with the affluent Joneses by borrowing</a> to supplement their consumption. Often they borrowed against rising home values, against the collateral of unrealized capital income. (In some cases this income never would be realized, after it disappeared during the 2008 financial crisis.) Uncollateralized credit card borrowing also exploded during this period. Credit <em>really</em> got democratized during the early 2000s when <a href="https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2007/03/unwinding-fraud-for-bubbles.html">origination fraud</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_income,_no_asset">NINJA loans</a> were added to the mix.</p>
    <p>In 1995, Lawrence Lindsey <a href="https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/federal%20reserve%20history/bog_members_statements/lindsey_19950110.pdf">coined the term</a> "democratization of credit", in order to answer the question "Where are consumers getting their money?":<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>[T]wo key financial innovations have eased the liquidity constraints that households face… The first is the increased ease with which housing may be turned into collateral for a mortgage. The second is the incredible increase in the use of credit card and other installment debt… [U]nsecured consumer credit growth seems to be entering an unprecedented period… While all of this… may sound bleak, there is an important bright spot in the trends described here. One of the key points that has been overlooked by many commentators is the increased democratization of credit in America… Recent developments in housing finance… show a very large expansion of credit opportunities and therefore homeownership opportunities for traditionally underserved groups… I do not believe it is possible, however, to attribute anything approaching a majority of the current very expansive use of consumer credit to positive sociological factors… [G]rantors of consumer credit may now have collectively taken on a macroeconomic responsibility they did not seek. The evidence indicates that the old liquidity constraint which used to discipline household consumption behavior has been replaced by a new constraint -- the credit card limit.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>At a very high level, the response of a motley alliance of plutocrats and technocrats to the trauma of the 1970s had been to make the rich richer and most of the public poorer. Plutocrats were for this because, of course. Technocrats did not favor the inequality <em>per se</em>, but they wanted to decouple macroeconomic management from politically inflexible wage income.</p>
    <p>The majority of the public was made poorer than they would have been, and ought to have objected, but we mostly remember this period as good times. There was the late 1990s stock market boom, but most people did not substantially participate in that (and then there was the bust).</p>
    <p>Instead, many households enjoyed growing consumption thanks to an increase in their ability to supplement their purchasing power with borrowing, which helped offset the loss of purchasing power they experienced from reduced real wage income.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, replacing wage income with borrowing at best renders household balance sheets more fragile (when, for example, households are borrowing against rising home values), and potentially drives households to outright insolvency (when they run up uncollateralized consumer debt). Chickens would eventually come home to roost.</p>

Collapsing into Great Disillusionment (2008 - 2020)<a name="pocketbook-history-US-macro-regimes_section_5" href=""></a></h3>
    <p>The Great Financial Crisis happened. I won't go into it. Read my <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/date/2008/09">archives</a> for my thoughts on that pain in real time.</p>
    <p>For our purposes here, the Great Financial Crisis had two relevant effects. First, it killed the democratization of credit. Less well-off people could no longer borrow nearly as easily. Lots of people emerged from the crisis with damaged credit histories and would have difficulty borrowing at all. Second, it did not kill the Great-Moderation regime under which wage income would be suppressed in favor of capital income. It took <a href="https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2018/02/update-scariest-jobs-chart-ever.html">76 months</a> for employment to recover from the 2008 downturn. It only took about 66 months for the S&amp;P 500 to soar past its prior new peak. By the beginning of 2020, the S&amp;P 500 had more than doubled from its prior peak — after paying dividends — while total labor compensation, in nominal terms, had grown only <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MyU7">about 30%</a>.</p>
    <p>Despite (to their credit!) eventually tolerating unemployment levels way below 90s-style NAIRU estimates, economic policymakers found it difficult to sustain robust demand without the exuberant borrowing of the democratization-of-credit era. Only in early 2018, after a decade of underperformance, did <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MyUu">US GDP reach estimates of potential GDP</a>. From the end of 2008 to the end of 2015, the Fed's policy rate was <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL072052006Q">stuck at the zero-lower bound</a>, suggesting an economy policymakers understood to be starved for demand which conventional tools could not stimualte. Until 2014, the Fed expanded its balance sheet in a practice it called "quantitative easing", deploying an unconventional tool to make up for the missing demand. Policymakers relied on stimulating financial asset prices rather than, say, fiscal expenditures structured to help bid up wages. Despite all that had gone wrong and growing political turmoil, the Great Moderation "lesson" was not unlearned. Finance, rather than wages or transfers, remained the instrument of demand management.</p>
    <p>We mostly remember the democratization-of-credit era as good times, a period of prosperity. Even though wage incomes were suppressed, we enjoyed a brisk economy and broad based consumption growth.</p>
    <p>We do not remember the 2010s as good times. The 2010s is when we really felt the inequality that had been metastatizing in our economic statistics for decades. The financialized well-off in America somehow weathered the "financial" crisis and were rewarded with recovering, then booming, asset values. The less well-off simply afforded less. They "adjusted", in economists' deceptively bloodless term for suffering.</p>
    <p>The Great Disillusionment gave us Donald Trump, the first time around, as a well-deserved but ill-chosen middle finger to the policy establishment that had walked us all along this path, to this place.</p>
    <p>By the end of the decade, it was unclear whether the Great Moderation policy regime — wage suppression, financial stimulus to fill in the gap — might change. Wages underwhelmed, but that seemed to be despite rather than because of policymakers' efforts. The Fed tolerated low (by recent decade standards) unemployment in the late 2010s, as it had in the late 1990s. Inflation risks seemed very distant. We were consistently <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MyVH"><em>undershooting</em> the Fed's informal 2% PCE inflation target</a>. Policymakers did not foresee or fear an environment in which strong labor bargaining power might create difficult tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. In public communications, they were if anything contrite about the prior decades' sluggish wage growth, and willing to experiment with potentially more aggressively stimulative policy, like "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy-2019-2020.htm">flexible average inflation targeting</a>".</p>

    <p>Whether policymakers intended or did not intend to shift from the Great Moderation policy regime, that regime performed exactly as designed during the sudden, sharp inflation that began early in 2021 and peaked in the summer of 2022. The Fed raised interest rates and made it clear that they were <em>not</em> interested in supporting asset prices. From January to October 2022, the S&amp;P 500 fell by 25%, and the inflation began to subside, even as the unemployment rate somewhat <em>declined</em>.</p>
    <p>It is unknowable<sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> the degree to which the decline of inflation was due to monetary policy — and the collapse of asset prices and financial income it helped provoke — versus businesses simply working out supply-chain snarls and adjusting to shifts in consumer preference after COVID.</p>
    <p>However, something peculiar has happened in the aftermath of the inflation. The demand-deficient 2010s are a lost continent, a strange dream we now barely remember. Perhaps it is not that demand has grown robust, but that supply has grown brittle. To the inflation targeter it's all the same. The economic policy apparatus remains unnerved by the recent inflation and on-guard against a possible resurgence. Under these circumstances, one might have expected — indeed I did expect — that policymakers would not be very eager to see a sharp recovery in asset prices. After the S&amp;P 500 fell in 2022, and then inflation subsided, policymakers could have pocketed that disinflationary impulse. They could have made clear a reluctance to see asset prices soar, and used tools like threats of even higher rates and aggressive quantitative tightening to prevent a new asset price boom.</p>
    <p>They have done no such thing. Under both Joe Biden and now Donald Trump, policymakers have accommodated exuberant asset markets.</p>
    <p>Very recently, but only very recently, there has been some hint of a potential employment recession. But policymakers accommodated (and of course bragged about) the asset boom long before there was any hint of recession, while the pain of and potential for inflation was still top-of-mind. Why?</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, of course we could have stopped the inflation with sufficiently tight policy. We did not, because doing so would have been so economically destructive, or so dangerous to political stability, that enduring the inflation was worth avoiding those costs and risks. The baby boomers had to be employed, at wages that would endow their independence, even if the cost of ensuring that they were was a prolonged inflation with unjust distributional effects.</p>
    <p>In 2022, we could have dramatically reduced ongoing inflation risk by simply <em>abstaining</em> from an ascending asset price path, of stock prices and also housing. But, with a few temporary setbacks, we have been on this ascending asset price path <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/07/10/cornering-the-future/index.html">since the mid-1980s</a>, and to the most affluent, best enfrachised fractions of our public, the continuing of its ascension has evolved into a kind of <a href="https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1774885794513072552">social contract</a>. I would guess that a political system under Donald Trump is even more interested in seeing "number go up", and more allergic to asset price declines, than the political system captained by Joe Biden.</p>
    <p>So, in a way, we find ourselves back in the 1970s. We don't face inflationary demographics. But we are susceptible to negative supply shocks, due to tariffs, and our determination to decouple from China, and just the error and noise that comes with Donald Trump's improvisational leadership style. Those negative supply shocks will become inflations, unless the policy apparatus can restrain demand to hold the price level steady. But restraining demand now means reining in asset prices, or even encouraging asset price declines, which the American leadership class, including both Republican-coded plutocrats and Democrat-coded professionals, seems unwilling to tolerate beyond very short-term wobbles.</p>
    <p>The American public, when composed as an electorate, detests inflation much more than it detests asset price declines or even employment recessions. But it is not the American public that decides these things, and here in 2025, it's not clear how much capacity an increasingly manipulated and gerrymandered and suppressed electorate will have to hold policymakers to account. Our leaders might well choose, or try to choose, booming assets and elevated inflation. Stephen Miran, if not quite choosing that, is <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20250922a.htm">choosing to err in that direction</a>.<sup id="fnref-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p>
    <p>Alternatively, if a continuing asset boom is non-negotiable and inflation is absolutely to be avoided, our leaders might choose to use an expansion of inequality as a disinflationary policy instrument. Inequality is disinflationary because of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/4831.html">marginal-propensity-to-consume effects</a>. The very rich mostly bank any new income, while the less rich spend what they get, bidding for goods and services. If you can transfer income from the less-rich to the very rich, you reduce bids for scarce goods and services, and so reduce upward pressure on prices.</p>
    <p>Withdrawing income from the very poor would have little disinflationary effect. Even though the very poor spend almost all of their income, they don't have enough of it to matter. To use inequality as a disinflationary instrument, you'd want to transfer incomes from the middle class to the very wealthy.</p>
    <p>There's nothing new about this. It's part of why the Reagan Revolution was persistently disinflationary. Yawning inequality is much of the reason inflation became so distant a risk since the 1980s, why more frequently than we've had to worry about inflation, we've had to drop interest rates to near zero in order to stimulate.</p>
    <p>But now, due to politics and geopolitics, we are at risk of powerful negative supply shocks. We may soon face a choice of tolerating serious inflation, ending our addiction to asset prices, or taking inequality to a whole new level.</p>
    <p>More speculatively, if we had any sense, if we weren't idiots, we would forswear <em>all</em> of downwardly rigid wages, inequality-expanding capital income, and household-balance-sheet destroying borrowings as instruments to modulate aggregate demand. We'd <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/918.html">adjust some form of transfer income</a> instead.</p>

       <p>You might object that increasing interest rates also increases creditors' incomes, so wouldn't that stimulate demand? To a degree. But that effect is offset by declining asset values, and especially by the reduction of new borrowers. Borrowers spend the money they borrow. Creditors often just bank the interest they own. This effect might become reversed if the public debt were sufficiently large, and the holders of that debt sufficiently inclined to spend out of marginal income, but so far that has not been the case, and it certainly was not in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

In the early post-crisis era, older affluent Americans were I think more tilted towards bonds than they are now, and much more conscious of the risks of equity investing. The generation that has taken their place treats index funds as safe and wise, the thing to be invested in for any horizon longer than about five years. BTFD. Unfortunately, that has not meant we've transitioned from creditors' rentierism to running a broad-based hot economy. It has just meant number must go up, whether it goes up because firms produce in greater quantity at moderate margins, or because they squeeze customers, workers, and vendors to expand margins, or simply via spiraling multiples. Everyone still hates inflation! But while a prior generation would have firmly preferred stagnant equity prices if that's what would insure the real value of their bond portfolios, a new generation has counted its equity chickens long before they'll hatch, and would find a tradeoff between low inflation and index-fund appreciation a closer-run thing.</p>

    <p>I condemn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Charlie_Kirk">murder of Charlie Kirk</a>.</p>
    <p>Without caveat, without any "buts".</p>
    <p>Like all of us, Kirk was a mixed bag. "The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either — but right through every human heart — and through all human hearts," Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn famously wrote. So it was for Charlie Kirk.</p>
    <p>Kirk's politics were <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/charlie-kirk-ezra-klein-tanehisi-coates">vile</a>. But he was a remarkable talent. His approach to doing politics — not so much his <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/17/the-debate-me-bro-grift-how-trolls-weaponized-the-marketplace-of-ideas/">too-online debate performances</a>, but <a href="https://tpusa.com/">Turning Point USA</a>'s building of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/opinion/charlie-kirk-democrats-men.html">belonging-first</a> membership organization — is admirable. It is how politics <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6732.html">should be done</a>. I lament that more civilized political communities have failed where Kirk succeeded.</p>
    <p>None of this matters to the question of Kirk's murder, though.</p>
    <p>Murder is bad. It's the easiest call.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/09/us/charlotte-train-stabbing-ukrainian-victim">Iryna Zarutska's murder</a> on a Charlotte light-rail train was horrible. I condemn it unreservedly.</p>
    <p>I dislike the way a certain political community, broadly <a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3Acharliekirk11%20Zarutska&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Charlie Kirk's</a> political community, has transformed her murder into "evidence" for their theory of a woke conspiracy to suppress coverage of black-on-white crime. What's unusual about this tragedy is not the limited coverage of a random homicide in an American city. We have those every day, alas. What distinguishes Zarutska's murder is the existence of a strikingly brutal snuff film and a strikingly beautiful victim, which made it possible for the incident to be animated into a national obsession.</p>
    <p>Zarutska's murderer is a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/mother-sister-charlotte-stabbing-suspect-describe-history-mental/story?id=125451590">violent schizophrenic who should not have been on the streets</a>. How to manage people who require support and supervision, in a manner respectful of their rights but also others' safety, is a question to which we've collectively thrown up our hands. The murderer may have referred to his victim as "that white girl", but mostly he seemed confused about his action. "Make sure it was me that did it, not the material. And I'm telling you, the material did it… I never said not one word to the lady at all. That scary, ain't it? So, like, why would somebody stab somebody for no reason?" The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3-bOlqL0mM">smarter MAGA-ists</a> understand that the racial dimension of the crime is weak, so they play up a racial dimension of a supposed cover-up.</p>
    <p>Zarutska is innocent of all that. Probably she <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DObHqkfj9uC/">would not approve of it</a>.</p>
    <p>Perhaps Kirk was principled enough that he would not approve of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-09-17/nexstars-abc-affiliates-drop-jimmy-kimmel-live-over-charlie-kirk-remarks">the</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/bondi-says-justice-department-will-target-users-of-hate-speech-247704645600">McCarthyite</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/newsjennifer.bsky.social/post/3lyw7eaaxi22x">speech</a> <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/public-figures-fired-over-charlie-kirk-comments-matthew-dowd-and-more/">crackdown</a> his murder has provoked from his own political allies.</p>
    <p>Both of them are dead. They don't get a say in these things.</p>
    <p>On the same day Kirk was killed, two students were wounded in a school shooting <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/article/evergreen-high-school-shooters-online-activity-reveals-fascination-mass-shootings">apparently motivated by the nihilistic white supremicist ideology</a> that often motivates school shootings. The victims were not killed, thank goodness. Only the shooter died, by suicide. "Only."</p>
    <p>All of this is tragedy.</p>
    <p>Last week, responding to Zarutska's murder, Fox commentator Brian Kilmeade <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lypzw476j723">suggested</a> for the difficult homeless "involuntary lethal injection, or something. Just kill them." He later, to his credit, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lysedkdgm22k">retracted the remark and apologized</a>.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, on Monday, two homeless encampments in Minneapolis were <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/people-hurt-mass-shootings-minneapolis-homeless-encampments/story?id=125620641">shot up</a>. Is there a relationship between Kilmeade's remarks and these events? We don't know. Probably we never will. I don't suggest we charge Kilmeade with a crime, even if he had not recanted. As <a href="https://xcancel.com/charliekirk11/status/1786189687260103119">Charlie Kirk</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.com/@ghostofgtc/post/DOrwd2gjuBJ">Tucker Carlson</a> remind us, free speech in the United States encompasses hate speech, and that's a better choice than allowing the state to invent shifting criteria for what speech is so hateful that it should be criminalized. I presume Brian Kilmeade is a person of conscience. I don't envy him the questions he must be asking himself after this week's events.</p>
    <p>Also on Monday, on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115210075167747572">Donald Trump's orders</a>, the US military blew up a boat in the Caribbean, ending the lives of three people. The allegation is they were drug runners. On September 2, eleven people were killed in a similar incident. Yesterday President Trump <a href="https://x.com/rapidresponse47/status/1967951008161825149">said</a> we'd in fact "knocked off" three boats, though we know very little about the third.</p>
    <p>Each of the people on these boats were as human as Charlie Kirk, as precious as Irina Zarutska. These people too were husbands, fathers, daughters, mothers. They had dreams, futures.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you are willing to give the Trump administration the benefit of the doubt, that it had ironclad intelligence these were drug-runners and not (or not accompanied by) <a href="https://www.wlrn.org/americas/2025-09-14/venezuelan-gang-expert-u-s-risks-casualties-of-innocents-with-caribbean-military-anti-drug-mission">migrants</a> fleeing the catastrophe that Venezuela has become. Whoever these people are, or were, Solzhenitsyn's remark applies just as strongly to them. "The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either — but right through every human heart — and through all human hearts."</p>
    <p>These were human beings, not even alleged to be military combatants or terrorists. They would not have been given the death penalty if convicted of the crimes of which they are accused.</p>
    <p>They were not convicted. They have not been indicted. They were killed, not in any kind of self-defense. They had no opportunity to contest the charges against them or to surrender if the charges were accurate. They were extrajudicially executed on the President's say so. They were murdered.</p>
    <p>President Trump <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOo4MACEerb/">remarked</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>We're seeing that there are no ships in the ocean anymore ... no there are no boats. I wonder why? Meaning, no drugs are coming across. Probably stopping some fishermen too. To be honest, if I were a fisherman, I wouldn't want to go fishing either. "Maybe they think I have drugs downstairs."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If Mr. Trump is so certain our intelligence is ironclad, why would he fear? People fish for their livings. The President might have reassured them, you have nothing to worry about unless you are running drugs, we know who these people are. He did not. His Vice President <a href="https://xcancel.com/atrupar/status/1968378660496564407">echoed</a> the remark, "Hell, I wouldn't go fishing right now in that area of the world."</p>
    <p>Perhaps my sense of humor is underdeveloped.</p>
    <p>But I think murder is bad.</p>
    <p>Without caveat, without any "buts". It's the easiest call.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="entry-body">
   <div class="flexmark markdown">
    <p>I've been following with interest an argument between John Ganz and Eric Levitz, both of whom are writers I admire, on the role of polling in American politics. (See <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/against-polling">Ganz</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/458175/democrats-polls-immigration-moderation">Levitz</a>, <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/against-vulgar-positivism">Ganz</a>.)</p>
    <p>I'm on Ganz's side of the argument. I don't begrudge individual candidates who use private polling to help shape at the margin how they compete. But using polling at a systemic level, having a political party that defines and redefines itself in dialogue with public polling (and private donors) is corrosive to the project of electoral democracy.</p>
    <p>Levitz starts at the wrong place, and so ends up at the wrong conclusion. The unstated background is that we live in a country where there are the fascists and the Democrats, so we want the Democrats to win elections. The task before us is not to participate effectively in a larger system, a democracy, of which we (whoever we are) can only be one faction of many, but to see to it that Democrats in particular win elections. Questions of who we want to be or what we want to do are secondary. We must win elections, we must defeat the fascists, first. We have an instrumental task before us. We should use the tools that will help us most effectively accomplish that task.</p>
    <p>He then points out, accurately, that people who are active in politics are atypical and unrepresentative, so our intuitions about what voters might want are unreliable. (David Shor deserves a tip of the hat here.) We are at risk of motivated reasoning, of imagining that whatever <em>we</em> support, because <em>we</em> are sure it would be good, is what the electorate would vote for. We require an objective guide to discipline us, to help us get things right, in this preordained task of winning elections — not necessarily to accomplish anything in particular, but so that the fascists do not. Polling, as flawed as it is, is the best tool we have.</p>
    <p>Levitz's error is to imagine that it's possible to separate the background conditions under which all this makes sense from the approach that he advises. That there are the fascists and the Democrats, and we'd strongly prefer the Democrats to win elections so that the fascists do not, is not some eternal, preexisting fact about the world. Over many cycles, the interaction of America's two political parties created this reality. The approach to politics that Levitz advises, I would argue, helped to create it, and is unlikely to undo it.</p>
    <p>Levitz, for a moment, kind of recognizes this in <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/458175/democrats-polls-immigration-moderation">his piece</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>the actual dispute between Ganz and the popularists is not about whether public opinion can change, but about how much scope <em>Democratic politicians</em> have to reshape the views of swing voters — which is to say, voters who do not particularly trust Democratic politicians.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Why do voters so distrust Democratic politicians? What is the Democratic Party "brand", ever since Bill Clinton overthrew the settled commitments of the party, hired Dick Morris, and triangulated?</p>
    <p>I claim the helplessness and haplessness and electoral weakness of the Democratic Party <em>derives</em> in large part from party leaders taking the approach Levitz is so keen to defend. There really is no such thing as the Democratic Party anymore. The party's fortunes are just a referendum on how much the public hates Republicans at any given moment. Fortunately, Republicans govern so terribly that, while elections have been free and fair, even an empty suit, "Generic Democrat", has often been competitive.</p>
    <p>To be fair, I should point out that Republicans are not so different. In order to help Donald Trump win, the Republican Party set aside its commitment to abortion-is-murder ideology, and to policies that would follow from that ideology, like a national abortion ban. America's two-party system renders it structurally untenable for either party to abstain entirely from shifting with the winds of public opinion.</p>
    <p>However. Say what you will about MAGA Republicans, there is some actual content to their agenda that is solid and settled, that they will pursue regardless of public opinion, donor outrage, and everything else. The public doesn't like detention camps and mass deportation. But that's the very heart of what MAGA is and they'll move Heaven and Earth to do it. My view is this tenacity, this transparent committedness, is a large part of why they won, even though <em>what</em> they were committed to was never popular.</p>
    <p>In the American political system, the marginal voter who decides Presidential elections is the voter least interested in, most aloof from, the matters over which the two parties contest. If, like me, the concerns that drive you are inequality and a commitment to social democracy, you voted for Democrats (as I did). If you are a businessperson whose interest in politics is primarily about getting taxed and regulated less, you voted for Republicans.</p>
    <p>The people "in the middle" aren't people with "moderate" views on these issues. They are people who just don't think or care about them. It's not that they are inherently apolitical. It's just that whatever concerns might move them are not matters of active contestation between the parties.</p>
    <p>An example in the recent presidential cycle is Gaza. People whose core political concern was the plight of the Palestinians didn't have a clear choice in the election. The two parties, the two Presidential candidates, did not draw plain, strong, lines between their positions. These people, many of whom might have been reliable Democrats when other issues were top-of-mind for them, became "marginal voters", who might have voted either way or not at all — not because they didn't care, but because they perceived their core political concern to be unaddressed by either party.</p>
    <p>Gaza-focused "uncommitted" voters were a small fraction of the electorate. But the whole strata that constitutes "the marginal voter" has this in common — that whatever the two parties are actively contesting, it is not what they most care about. To comitted partisans, it feels like we are governed by aliens or chaos monkeys or coin flips, because <em>we</em> see very important stakes and then electoral outcomes that make no sense given the gravity of what will be lost. But the marginal voter does not see so much at stake. Things will be fine either way, she thinks, or she thinks it's all going to hell whichever of these assholes gets elected. Her vote is based on other things. Parasocial attachment, I've <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/11/08/its-the-parasocials-stupid/index.html">argued</a>, is a big determinant of how these people actually vote.</p>
    <p>But another big determinant, I think, is <em>candor</em>. Before you can even evaluate candidates or parties "on the issues", before it even makes sense to do so, you have to believe there is some straightforward relationship between how they present themselves, what they actually believe, and what they would do. A candidate who promises things you'd love but who is merely pandering to you and would not in fact work to make those things happen is not even right. A candidate who won't tell you what they really think or what they would do is hard to evaluate, and in a deep sense is doing something discreditable, committing a kind of crime against democracy, by failing to meet the basic preconditions under which electoral democracy makes sense.</p>
    <p>I think the marginal voter often votes, whether for a person, or a movement, or a political party, on the basis of perceived candor. If I am right, then the technocratic instrumentalism that Levitz advises will prove, has already proved, self-defeating, on its own terms. And that technocratic instrumentalism, intended in opposition to fascism and therefore in the service of democracy, is itself a kind of subversion of democracy.</p>
    <p>The whole point of a democracy is that no one can know what a public truly wants, both in the weak sense of subjectively wanting and the stronger sense of what would be in the public's interest. Democracy is precisely the project of constructing institutions not to measure or act upon some nonsensical notion of the public will, but to constitute a thing that the public recognizes <em>ex post</em> as its will (or at least does not rebel against as completely antithetical to its will), and that delivers outcomes that render at least passably contented an always fractious and divided collectivity.</p>
    <p>If the true public will existed as a thing that could just be measured and correctly known, we'd have no need for democracy, at least not for anything like electoral democracy. "Consultative democracy", in which experts simply measure the true will of the public and acted correctly on its behalf, would be the obviously superior system. But the true public will does not exist. We have to construct, to constitute, one of many possible versions of it ourselves. How we constitute it will determine who we collectively are, how we will collectively understand ourselves going forward, how we act, whether we will live well or poorly or outright destroy ourselves.</p>
    <p>"Popularism" as a project can be understood narrowly as a very instrumental — some might say cynical — approach to contesting elections. But I think there's often a broader and more deeply <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6400.html">misguided</a> vision behind it, a conceit that expert social science, relying on institutions like public polling, can supplant or circumvent or supersede messy, corrupt politics. This is the <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/HOMUNCUL.html">homonculous theory</a> of democracy. It disdains the partisan and polemic, in favor of scientific rationality. It imagines there's some "truer" procedure that we can measure our democracy against. It's a project in denial of the human condition — that we fundamentally cannot know how collectively to act or even how we "want" collectively to act, yet we must nevertheless act, together, in time and in the world. We must grope in the darkness to invent institutions, and then only afterwards see whether they function well or poorly, and do our best to adjust.</p>
    <p>Representative democracy requires ideologues, sincere partisans, people genuinely committed to a way of going forward. That renders it possible for elections to constitute a representative body of such partisans to deliberate on affairs of state and make laws. When political parties reshape themselves on the basis of polling, it renders the whole process nonsensical, a kind of infinite regress. It deprives the public of meaningful choice in the name of giving it what it wants.</p>
    <p>The United States has a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">shitty electoral system</a>. It is structurally incapable of providing the public adequate choice, of offering voters a wide range of sincere partisans from which to constitute the legislature, the mini-public that governs.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, much of the public does understand that voting for people who have no settled views but are only pandering for your votes is not really voting for anyone or anything at all. The more poll-tested a candidate is, inherently the less worthy. We are living in the aftermath of the public insisting that it's better to vote for people you can trust to be who they claim to be and act accordingly than to just have no idea and let the insiders have at.</p>
    <p>There's no such thing as the true public will. Nevertheless, perhaps polyannishly, I'll claim the American public does not, in fact, really favor the American Nazis. But the marginal voter, the weird sliver of the public that decides American Presidential elections, did favor the American Nazis over the who-the-fuck-knows-they're-just-triangulating party. I don't think we'll overthrow the Nazis by listening and hedging and triangulating more.</p>
