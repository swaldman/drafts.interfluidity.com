  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Remember when the byproduct of capitalists making money <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm">was</a></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Capitalism now, at least in America, feels a lot more... flaccid.</p>
   <p>To be sure, money is being turned into more money more rapidly than ever before. But the gearing between that process and actual production of real-world goods and services seems weak.</p>
   <p>This is admittedly hard to measure. So many goods and services are digital now, and we can only really quantify them by "value", by how much people are willing to pay for them. If people are willing to pay half a trillion dollars to Google and Facebook (er, "Alphabet" and "Meta") for ads, should we hail that as our generation's equivalent of the application of chemistry to industry and agriculture?</p>
   <p>You can be as apologist was you wanna be. But I'll go with "no". In fields that require mastery over the forces of nature — rather than just mastery over one another's wallets — <a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-03-28-suicide-mission-boeing/">Boeing</a> really is the iconic American company.</p>
   <p>Here's a simple theory.</p>
   <p>Marx <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm">famously described</a> the general formula of capital as M-C-M'. While ordinarily economists think of money as merely an intermediary in, or a veil over, the exchange of real goods and services (C-M-C), for the capitalist, real goods and services are the mere intermediary, in a process that turns money into more money.</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>the money itself is only one of the two forms of value. Unless it takes the form of some commodity, it does not become capital. There is here no antagonism, as in the case of hoarding, between the money and commodities. The capitalist knows that all commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell, are in faith and in truth money, inwardly circumcised Jews, and what is more, a wonderful means whereby out of money to make more money.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Setting aside the gratuitous antisemitism, in Marx's time the capitalist was typically <em>acquainted</em> with "commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell".</p>
   <p>The capitalist purchased the odiferous commodities himself. He managed, understood, and oversaw highly technical processes by which stinky raw materials were transformed into items suitable for sale to yield that sweet M'.</p>
   <p>Now let's think about what happens when capitalism evolves to a more indirect form. Consider the following circuit: M-(M-C-M')-M'</p>
   <p>Here we describe a new breed of capitalist who treats the old capitalist's enterprise as itself a quasicommodity by which an initial investment M might be converted to a greater sum of money M'. In the course of this transaction, the initial capitalist is converted to a mere manager, or else retires and is replaced by a manager.</p>
   <p>The new purchaser does not herself take on the role of our first capitalist. Perhaps she tours the facilities occasionally, but in general she need never smell the stink of the commodities before they are reconverted to sell and smell like roses. She engages in a purely financial transaction. She pays M, receives control rights, and hopes by virtue of this process to earn a juicy M'.</p>
   <p>There are two things to notice. First, our new purchaser has little ability to contribute directly to the technical quality or efficiency of the production process. From her corner office in a distant skyscraper, she can only ever understand that process in the most abstract terms. Perhaps on the business side of the enterprise that she has purchased she can help a bit. Perhaps the accounting systems can be replaced with something more modern and shared across her other holdings, yielding a genuine efficiency.</p>
   <p>But to the core technical competence of the firm, she can contribute nothing, directly. Its work is simply outside of her domain.</p>
   <p>Perhaps she can contribute indirectly, however. Perhaps at the original firm, the original owner — 19th-Century capitalist bastard though he was — had personal relationships with his most skilled employees, his most loyal customers, the ecosystem of vendors from whom he purchased what to Marx becomes only C. Perhaps because of those relationships, the old man was paying more to his employees than their replacement cost in the labor market. Perhaps, recalling a time when his vendors kept him afloat through a cash flow crisis, our capitalist did not always aggressively bid contracts for his inputs and go with the lowest cost provider. Perhaps work conditions for employees, many of whom he personally knew, were expensively pretty nice. Perhaps he kept prices stable for long-time customers even when the market would bear more, increasing production or delaying opportunities to win new customers in order to prevent stock outs. Perhaps he maintained a level of quality greater than was strictly necessary to make his sales.</p>
   <p>Our 19th Century capitalist was no altruist. He didn't do these things because he was a nice guy. He believed that by treating his employees, vendors, and most loyal customers well, he was being "long-term greedy".</p>
   <p>He might have been right, but he might have been wrong too. The optimal give in the give-and-take of positive-sum human relationships is difficult to compute objectively. The milk of human kindness, especially towards people one knows and has known for a very long time, might become a source of cognitive bias.</p>
   <p>So, our purchaser in her corner skyscraper might actually contribute to the financial efficiency of the core business process simply by a squeeze. If, by hypothesis, the enterprise was overpaying its workers, undercharging its customers, overpaying its vendors, and overspending on quality, then draining the enterprise of cash and keeping it under financial pressure might help remedy that. Our new purchaser might even contribute to the <em>technical</em> efficiency of the core business process if, for example, the work environment previously had been so comfortable that workers had little incentive to innovate labor-saving improvements. Reduce the head count, and perhaps the remaining workers will develop ways of getting the same work done. That would be a real efficiency for the firm, and for the economy as a whole, as the workers who were laid off can be reemployed to produce other goods elsewhere.</p>
   <p>So, the M-(M-C-M')-M' process may genuinely yield economic efficiencies. But it remains the case that the controlling party is more removed from the technical details of production than the controlling party in a traditional M-C-M' operation. And beyond quickly exhausted one-offs like accounting synergies, she only has one lever by which to use her control to improve business efficiency: Squeeze.</p>
   <p>Now consider the following circuit: M-(M-(M-(M-C-M')-M')-M')-M'</p>
   <p>Perhaps what initially was a small firm with its own factory is purchased by a regional supplier which is purchased by a national firm which is purchased by a private equity firm.</p>
   <p>With every level of indirection, the controlling interest grows informationally more distant from the technology of production. It remains capable of affecting the core production process itself only via a single lever, the squeeze.</p>
   <p>In the one-level M-(M-C-M')-M' case, we hypothesized that perhaps the initial entrepreneur really was overpaying, undercharging, and underinnovating, out of cognitive biases derived from being too close to the nexus of relationships that constitute the firm. But the entrepreneur's "long-term greedy" theory was never wrong in principal. It <em>is</em> possible to underpay ones workers and vendors, overcharge ones customers, skimp on quality, in ways that improve short-term profits but impair the long-term value of the enterprise.</p>
   <p>In the one-level case, the controlling interest may retain some capacity to judge and balance. The former owner, now the manager, of the enterprise can make his case for why it'd be foolish to sharply hike a big loyal customer's price to whatever the market will bear, why accepting a bit of opportunity cost might be better for the firm over time. Shop-level management still has the ear of the controlling interest, who may be convinced that some indulgence of customers, vendors, and labor is in fact worthwhile. Sure, the buyer should squeeze. But she should squeeze only so hard.</p>
   <p>But once you get to M-(M-(M-(M-C-M')-M')-M')-M', that informational connection is entirely lost. If all you have is a hammer, every problem is a nail. If all you have is the squeeze, every problem must be inefficient slack. With each new level of indirection comes an increased bias to squeeze, and decreased information about intangible, forward-looking costs of the austerity you are imposing.</p>
   <p>Where our 19th Century entrepreneur may have suffered a bias towards overindulgence, our highly indirect owner suffers a bias towards "penny wise pound foolish".</p>
   <hr>
   <p>If this were the end of our story, capitalism red in tooth and claw might eventually sort things out for us. Enterprises too indirectly owned would make choices that, over time, would work out more poorly than "less efficient", less indirectly owned firms. The market might settle on some optimal degree of indirection.</p>
   <p>But another factor interferes.</p>
   <p>Indirection comes not only with depth, but with breadth and scale. Breadth and scale confer capabilities that, to the controlling interest, are real opportunities, but that to society at large must be scored as costs.</p>
   <p>For more on that we must wait until Part II.</p>

  <h1><a href="2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">How to understand approval voting</a></h1>
 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>The electoral system I favor for most elected positions is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">approval voting</a>.</p>
   <p>Under approval voting, voters are handed ballots identical to the ones they currently receive. The only difference is that instead of being asked to select our <em>one most favored candidate</em>, we are asked to select <em>one or more candidates</em> of whom we would "approve" for each position.</p>
   <p>Votes are tallied just like they are now. Every votes is counted, and the candidate with the most votes wins. Every candidate is allocated all of the votes they received, regardless of whether a voter selected one or several candidates. Approval voting is extremely simple.</p>
   <p>Approval voting addresses what voters most detest about the current system, that often we cannot express our true views without empowering those we most oppose.</p>
   <p>Suppose you are some neocon, neoliberal, never-Trump person. You don't like Joe Biden. He's been veering towards social democracy, which you call "communism". But Trump, Trump is an idiot moral catastrophe who will destroy America. Under the current system, your only choice is to hold your nose and vote for the communist. Even if your true heartthrob — Mitt Romney! — could be persuaded to run as a third-party candidate, you couldn't vote for him. It would split the anti-Trump coalition. Given the dominance of the two big parties in America, a vote for a third party means a vote withheld from one of the candidates that might actually win. So if you care about the consequences of your vote rather than mere narcissistic self-expression, you have to vote for the one of the two major parties you think least bad, rather than for the third-party candidate you love. But then the fact that you do this, and that everybody else does this, cements in place the dominance of two parties few of us are very happy with.</p>
   <p>Approval voting lets us break the cycle. Under approval voting, our beleaguered neolib neocon can put a check next to Mitt's name on her ballot, and also next to Comrade Joseph's. The first time around, while the two-party habit is still strong among us, the vote for Mitt is probably just self-expression. But it's no longer narcissistic self-expression, because now it does no harm. The vote for Biden still sets Trump back just as fully as it would have under our current system. And the self-expression is productively <em>public</em>. When votes are tallied, if a silent near-majority has expressed its love of Mitt and his new Old-Tyme Republican Party, voters will observe that, and next time around OTRP candidates will be real contenders rather than mere messaging.</p>
   <p>Under approval voting, voters can always vote their true preference without splitting their broader coalition and handing an advantage to the worst candidate. And because voters' actual preferences become publicly visible, the self-fulfilling dynamic that stabilizes our current two-party duopoly is undermined. Third-parties can emerge as contenders. Once major parties can submerge.</p>
   <p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">"Breaking the two-party doom loop"</a> is the first thing most discontents look for in electoral reform, and approval voting does that. But it does it in a way that has some really useful characteristics. In particular, <em>it privileges candidates who can reach across factional lines over candidates who appeal exclusively to their own factional base.</em></p>
   <p>In single-winner elections, where one person is going to have to serve a whole public, that person should be someone nearly everyone can live with, rather than a person adored by her own faction and hated by others. Elections ought not be contests over who will dominate whom. They are means by which we establish a government under which we all must thrive together.</p>
   <p>Not all elections should be single-winner elections! We absolutely do want the purest, strongest, and best expressions of all of our political factions to participate in government. We just don't want the purest, strongest, and best of <em>only one faction</em> dominating the government and usurping control of the state. At the Federal level, members of the US House of Representatives should be elected not by any single-winner voting scheme, but by one of the many electoral systems that yield proportional representation, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">MMP</a>, multi-winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single transferable vote</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_ballot">random ballot</a>. A deliberative body meant to represent and include the full diversity and cacophony of the polity is <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">quite different</a> from a single official who must serve the whole public. The two demand different kinds of elections.</p>
   <p>The US House should be assembled by proportional representation. The Senate, in which two at-large electeds must represent the whole publics of their states, should be selected by approval vote. That reform alone would dramatically alter the character of the body, and help render it a <a href="https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/senatorial-saucer/">cooling saucer</a> rather than a veto point for ideologues.</p>
   <p>Approval voting represents a very incremental reform. It is approximately the current system. The most obvious strategy for voters is simply to cast one vote for their most preferred candidate. Most people will likely do just that. If <em>everybody</em> did it, then nothing would have changed.</p>
   <p>But not everybody will vote only for their one favorite candidate. Some fraction of voters will "approve" two or more candidates.</p>
   <p>Contrary to some very mistaken presentations, people who select multiple candidates are not "casting multiple votes" and thereby usurping voting power, violating the principle of one-person-one-vote. On the contrary. Selecting multiple candidates under approval voting is an act of generosity. You have selected your first choice, but then you add a candidate that is someone else's first choice, that is lesser from your perspective, and put that candidate on an equal basis to your own. The more candidates you select, the less you are insisting "my way or the highway". You are supporting your way, but you are also assenting to other ways that are not yours, but you can live with. This inverse relationship between preference imposition and number selected becomes obvious when you consider what happens if a voter approves <em>every</em> candidate. That has the same effect on the outcome as simply not voting at all.</p>
   <p>So multiple selectors are generous voters. They are voters looking to find bridges and overlaps between their own preferences and those of other factions. And in what would be a close election if everybody chose only their fave — or under the current system — it is these generous voters, willing to make common cause with people whose values and interests differ somewhat from their own, who become kingmakers. Ironically, individually each voter cedes power by selecting more than one candidate. But as a class, approval voting elevates this group of less narrowly insistent voters to a position of influence.</p>
   <p>Approval voting disfavors "mobilize the base" electoral strategies in favor of outreach and persuasion. One shouldn't evaluate electoral systems only by the electoral outcomes they tend to produce, but also by how they shape the behavior of candidates and the electorate. Our current system, in which primaries favor factional extremists, who are then mostly either shoe-ins for their position or subject to coin-flip general elections, does more even than Elon Musk to turn politics into a carnival of performative whack. Approval voting would dramatically change candidate incentives, and by doing so, would dramatically change our society for the better, regardless of who wins the various contests. Approval voting promotes social cohesion.</p>
   <p>But wouldn't approval voting just elevate squish moderates, or even worse, "centrists"? I know, dear reader, you don't like "centrists". I detest "centrists". But what "centrism" has come to mean in American political discourse is the set of values and interests well served by the <em>status quo</em>, or at least the <em>status quo</em> as it prevailed until 2016. "Centrists" are socially liberal but fiscally conservative. "Centrists" don't want to tax billionaires, because they worry about incentives and "supply side effects" and whether soaking the rich would do "institutional violence" somehow to the country.</p>
   <p>The actual center of American opinion looks nothing at all like this. Across factional lines, taxing extraordinary wealth more heavily is close to universally popular. Only the very rich themselves, and the weird sliver of "centrists" that serves them, object. The actual center in the United States is less socially liberal on some causes than "centrists" (which is why "anti-woke" can be an effective populist strategy), but very liberal on reproductive rights, and is overwhelmingly live-and-let-live. Approval voting would give us politicians whose agendas would be better aligned with the actual center of the electorate. This would look nothing like the agenda of contemporary so-called "centrists" in politics and media.</p>
   <p>Approval voting would tend to yield candidates not perfectly aligned to my own socially liberal, social democratic views, but closer than what either party gives us now. And that would be the experience of most voters. From whatever direction we come, we do tend towards a common center when the politico-plutocratic freak show is not actively dividing us. Approval voting yields winners who deliver to no one everything they want. But its winners will be much closer to the vast majority than what's on offer from a duopoly that performatively chisels open social and cultural fissures in order to distract from a plutocratically constrained "consensus". And its winners will enjoy broader mandates than the <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7828.html">50% + one voter</a> that the current system tends to, making it easier for elected officials to actually get things done.</p>
   <p>Approval voting improves social cohesion. Social cohesion improves state capacity. State capacity deployed on behalf of a widely shared consensus improves all of our lives, in the ultimate virtuous circle.</p>

  <h1><a href="2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/index.html">Why does wage compression underwhelm?</a></h1>
 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Here's a graph from <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31010/w31010.pdf">Autor, Dube, &amp; McGrew</a> on "The Unexpected Compression":</p><img src="2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/hourly-wages-by-quintile-autor-dube.png" width="100%">
   <p>I agree with many commentators on the (economic) left and center-left that <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/11/30/obama-was-the-most-destructive-political-figure-of-my-lifetime/index.html">economic policy under the Biden Administration has been extraordinarily — and unexpectedly! — good</a>. But that policy excellence has not, um, trickled down, to satisfaction and enthusiasm among its supposed working class beneficiaries.</p>
   <p>Among so-called centrist pundits, as I (uncharitably) tend to read them, I detect a hint of outrage. The Biden Administration has been working for the plebes like no other administration in decades, yet the ingrates don't give the administration any credit. There are shades of the old <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/08/14/fascism-as-triage/index.html">"economic anxiety" debate</a>. Really, it's pointless to try to do anything for downscale Americans. They are just a bunch of racists or (in the case of Black and Latino men) chauvinists and traditionalists.</p>
   <p>I want to emphasize, the Biden Administration <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/biden-economy-voters-polling-numbers-covid-recovery.html">really has been working to serve the working class</a> like no administration in decades!</p>
   <p>But so far, from the perspective of regular humans, the results have been underwhelming. The trends are meaningfully positive, and given four more years — or better yet an electoral trifecta ‐ I think the Democrats might enjoy electoral dividends. But November 2024 is probably too early.</p>
   <p>The graph above is the center of the case for working-class ingratitude. Since Biden took office, wage growth at the bottom of the distribution has dramatically outstripped growth at the middle and the top. If you check out the <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31010/w31010.pdf">paper</a>, you'll find similar graphs showing that non-college-graduates have done better than college graduates, young workers have done better than older workers, low-wage occupations have done better than mid- or high-wage occupations. Looking only at these wage stats, you might argue that Biden economy has served youth and Trump's base especially well.</p>
   <p>However, if you were to look at this <a href="https://x.com/Markzandi/status/1771943167962583131">triumphalist post by Mark Zandi</a>, you might conclude that the Biden Administration has been working for rich assetholders:</p>
   <p class="text-align: center;"><img src="2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/zandi-asset-growth.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
   <p>It's a rising tide lifting all boats, right?!</p>
   <p>Well, maybe. But in relative terms, or as an expression of priorities, the administration can't be working for working people <em>and</em> for the well-to-do asset-holding class.</p>
   <p>In dollar-weighted terms, the wage gains at the lower-end of the working class represent a small fraction of the $300K per household that their betters have effortlessly enjoyed. As Zandi points out, the less-affluent 40% earns nearly none of that, so those wage gains are swimming to keep up with $500K among asset-holding households. More realistically, the middle of the distribution experienced much more modest gains, while households at the top earned millions and billions. Working people continue to fall behind the asset-holding class under Joe Biden, even as the wage component of income has compressed.</p>
   <p>In general, wage inequality is declining at the same time as the labor share of income — when measured correctly for distributional purposes, including capital gains — has <a href="https://wealtheconomics.substack.com/p/total-income-and-the-collapse-of">declined precipitously</a>.</p>
   <p>But it's worse than that. Asset wealth, at least in theory, represents claims on future cash flows that are going to be paid by someone. The appreciating "nonfinancial assets" in Zandi's graph represents home ownership becoming ever more inconceivable to much of the public. Institutional investors now pay those flows, in order to transform them into exorbitant rents that working people will pay without accumulating home equity. Soaring equity prices, if equity prices are growing faster than unit growth in goods and services, represent expectations of increased profit margins that working people will find embedded either in prices or subdued wages.</p>
   <p>It's true that asset price collapses tend to be bad for "Main Street" (if the government fails to do its job) because the investor class panics and fires everybody and generally throws a temper tantrum to remind the world to be solicitous of <a href="https://mronline.org/2010/05/22/political-aspects-of-full-employment/">"business confidence"</a>.</p>
   <p>But that asset price collapses can hurt working people does not imply that asset price booms are good for them. A great moderation in asset prices — in the cost of housing, in the profitability of firms — is what best serves working class people.</p>
   <p>Never mistake applause from <i>The Economist</i> for quality economic management. The correlation coefficient is quite negative.</p>
   <p class="text-align: center;"><img src="2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/economist-pumped-up.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
   <p>Finally, it's worth thinking about the lingering hangover from the past few years' inflation. Among the commentariat, the explanation I often hear (with a suppressed condescending tone of "oh those idiots") is that even though <em>inflation</em> has declined substantially, the price level has not, so people are mad that their groceries still cost more than prices they anchored on a few years ago. (The condescension comes from sophisticates' understanding that, although the policy apparatus strives to bring inflation down to target, it does not seek, and would not tolerate, outright deflation to reverse an increase in the overall price level.)</p>
   <p>I can condescend with the best of 'em, and I don't disagree that this is part of the story. But I think economically sophisticated commentators miss something much more obvious, which is that constant nominal wages at a constant price level feel to an individual worker very different from getting a 4% raise that fully covers 4% inflation.</p>
   <p>Obviously, in the second case, there is an issue of lags. Inflation tends to mount continuously, while compensatory raises happen in discrete steps. Workers suffer losses in purchasing power for some time, even if raises eventually undo them.</p>
   <p>But more fundamentally, workers often experience raises as <em>rewards</em>, as the fruit of their personal merit. If a worker is given a big raise, she usually doesn't attribute it to macroeconomic circumstances, but to her own hard work and savvy.</p>
   <p>If a worker earns a constant nominal salary at a constant price level, she just never got a raise. But if a person gets a 4% raise and the price level rises by 4%, her experience is she <em>earned</em> a 4% raise through sweat and skill and staying late, ginning up the nerve to ask, demanding, holding firm. But then Joe Biden came along and took it away from her with his inflation.</p>
   <p>Our graph shows low wage workers enjoying a "real wage increase" of roughly 4% from when Joe Biden took office in January 2021 until July 2023, adjusting for CPI-U inflation. In nominal terms, that translates to our worker struggling and striving and wheedling from her asshole boss raises of 21% over the period, and then watching inflation eat away nearly 80% of the gain. No wonder she's maybe a bit bitter.</p>
   <p>If she had some stock, or a home whose value jumped from $400K to $600K over the period, she might feel a bit better.</p>
   <p>But people like that, you know. They just never plan.</p>

   <p>Why has the stock market been so ebullient?</p>
   <p>Even by very forgiving measures like price-to-earnings, which presupposes <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A466RD3Q052SBEA">extraordinary profit margins</a> will be permanent, stocks are <a href="https://twitter.com/jessefelder/status/1768625428292599882">overvalued</a>.</p>
   <p>The question is academic to me now. The recent rally has wiped me out, replacing my short position with a shirtless one. Still, why does valuation seem more definitively and durably than ever before simply not to matter?</p>
   <p>I present for your consideration <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1gpS4#">a graph</a>:</p><img src="2024/03/20/a-simple-theory-of-the-stock-market/balsht-equity-to-public-debt.png" style="width: 100%;">
   <p>The denominator here is "Federal Debt Held By The Public", which is a good measure of US government paper issued, whether as US Treasuries directly, or as Treasury debt transformed by the Fed into bank reserves or currency. ("The public" in this measure includes the Federal Reserve, but the Federal Reserve's holdings of government debt are transformed into currency and reserves in the hands of the non-government public.)</p>
   <p>The numerator is the market value of corporate equities, held directly or via mutual funds, held by US households.</p>
   <p>Since the 2008 financial crisis, this ratio has stayed approximately constant. Basically, the total value of corporate equities gravitates around 1.4 times the quantity of Federal paper held by the public.</p>
   <p>This is quite different from the prior era, during which this ratio fluctuated widely.</p>
   <p>My explanation for this is very simple. Prior to 2008, equity holders as a class were engaging in speculations — or investments if you prefer — based volatile expectations surrounding corporate cash flows. There were periods of optimism (the late 1990s tech boom, the "democratization of credit" era that preceded the 2008 crisis), and periods of relative pessimism about corporate fortunes, all of which had little to do with the Federal government's debt position.</p>
   <p>2008 began an era of asset-allocation dominance. Equity holders, as a class, are no longer engaged in speculations — or investments if you prefer — in cash flow outcomes. They had been taught, for <a href="https://isbn.nu/9780070580435">at least a decade</a> by 2008, that evaluating cash flows like a classic investor is a mug's game. Since stocks are riskier than other securities, some natural law of the universe would always ensure they eventually return more than anything else. Old-fashioned ideas like "valuation" could only mislead investors into foolish exercises like market timing. Just think of equities writ large as an asset that will always yield higher returns than other asset classes, at the cost that you must tolerate greater fluctuations in value. Then divide your wealth between this "risky" class and other assets — like cash and bonds — in order to titrate your risk and maintain a cushion in case you need liquidity during one of the bad fluctuations.</p>
   <p>Obviously, asset-holders are heterogeneous, and not everybody behaves this way. People still do speculate on individual companies, evaluate growth prospects and cash flows, all of that. <em>Relative</em> performance within the broad class of equities still reflects expectations of firm-level analysts.</p>
   <p>But in aggregate, the public simply seeks a portfolio with a ratio of $1.40 of diversified equity for every $1 it holds of goverment paper, treating the precise composition of the equity as a secondary question.</p>
   <p>The price of government paper is largely pinned. There is some play in longer-term bonds, where investor behavior can muck with the term premium a bit, but for the most part, the value of government paper is set by face value, duration, and expectations surrounding the Fed. The price of equities, on the other hand, fluctuates freely.</p>
   <p>So what happens is pretty simple. Suppose we start at "equilibrium", investors hold $1.40 of equity for every $1 of US paper. Suddenly, the government spends some money, or just pays interest on its existing debt.</p>
   <p>Now the aggregate investment community is out of equilibrium. Cash (which, for our purposes, is just Federal paper in any form) is now a "hot potato", in the traditional metaphor. People have too much government paper, which they try to exchange for equities, but that just creates a hot potato in someone else's hands, unless and until the phrenetic equity-seeking bids up the price of existing equity in proportion to the new injection of government paper. Investors want their $1.4 in equities for every $1 of US paper. To a first approximation, the only thing that can adjust is the price of equities. So it does.</p>
   <p>The behavior that drives this — valuation independent "investment" into "diversified equities" as a black-box asset class — enjoys a great deal of elite-intellectual and policy support. It is what good upstanding prosperous professionals are told they are <em>supposed</em> to do with their savings. Once upon a time, equity investing was understood to be a high information, potentially quite dangerous activity that a relatively small fraction of the public would engage in. Now, among prosperous professionals, <em>failing</em> to be long equities is a mark of laziness, stupidity, or some form of financial dissidence. Being invested in equities "blindly" — by which I mean without picking stocks or using valuation to time exposure — is what conventional, smart, politically enfranchised people do.</p>
   <p>Inevitably, a policy apparatus evolves to stabilize whatever conventional, smart, politically enfranchised people do. Post-crisis, the Obama administration openly gauged the quality of the plans it would have Tim Geithner announce by the reaction of the stock market in the days following. Trump crowed about his stock market and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/487588-trump-signs-chart-showing-stock-market-rally-after-he-declared/">autographed</a> ascending charts that he thought he could take credit for. There has long been perceived to be a "<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1196599083.shtml">Fed put</a>". Economists like <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/prosperity-for-all-9780190621438?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Roger Farmer</a> have made stabilizing an ascending equity price path ever more acceptable in policy circles.</p>
   <p>Valuation-independent investor behavior forms a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2015/03/cryptoasset-valuation.pdf">Nash equilibrium around equity price expectations</a>, in the same way and by the same dynamics as cryptocurrency booms. Unlike cryptocurrency, for equities the equilibrium is also stabilized by a wide variety of policy actors and instruments. Disproportonately enfranchised affluent professionals — call them the "top 30%" — are equity holders who have come to rely upon high equity returns regardless of the timing or valuation of their purchases. Equities fluctuate, sometimes wildly, but the most enfranchised citizens now expect an upward ratchet over a five to ten year horizon. Speculators' own self-fulfilling behavior joins forces with tacit but determined state support to deliver on that expectation.</p>
   <p>As a normative matter, we'd be better off if "equities" were just some arbitrary token or cryptocurrency. Perhaps the state could offer EquityCoin in fixed quantity, or with some precommitted, demand-independent, issuance path. Wise men and talking heads could encourage conventional professionals to divide their wealth between government paper and holdings of EquityCoin, rather than buying actual corporate equities.</p>
   <p>People like to imagine that by purchasing corporate equity, they are "investing" in the economy, allocating capital, making resources available to enhance future production of the goods and services that make us all prosperous. But bidding up the prices of existing corporate equities mostly does nothing like this. To a certain degree, okay. As share prices grow, firms are able to compensate employees cash-cheaply with options. They can borrow to finance new projects more easily. They can acquire conservatively valued private firms in exchange for just a few of their own overpriced shares. Firms do find circuitous means to take advantage of high stock prices, so, in very limited ways, mere share price appreciation can contribute to production.</p>
   <p>But as long as there remains some pretense — however tenuous or residual — that equity prices represent capitalizations of future cash flows, high share prices also impose costs and obligations on firms that may be socially counterproductive. To support share prices, firms repurchase their own expensive stock, which <em>drains</em> companies of cash, and <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/159.html">concentrates losses</a> on long-term shareholders should valuations ever revert. Even if equity prices in aggregate are continually growing, at individual firms, managers struggle desperately to maintain the ratchet, to ensure whatever today's share price is, tomorrow's should be higher. Or at the very least — God help us — no lower.</p>
   <p>I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5031.html">have</a> <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9713.html">argued</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/06/04/quietly-expensive-desperation/index.html">before</a> that we should think of "greed" as something structural, institutional, rather than an innate, individual characteristic. High share prices render firms insecure and rapacious as managers seek to ratify and support nosebleed prices with actual cash flows. When current profits comfortably justify their share price, managers might be content to grow by expanding quantity-produced at existing margins. But when the share price they must defend is not so justified, the pressure for profit growth may compel the same human managers to aggressively seek means of gaining market power and expanding margins at the expense of customers, vendors, and workers.</p>
   <p>High share valuations are both a cause and effect of our terribly unequal, greed-inducing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew-effect-ridden</a> social arrangements. They are an <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/07/10/cornering-the-future/index.html">ethical catastrophe</a>. We should not want them, but it is hard for people whose 401(k)s are long the S&amp;P 500 to want to see them to disappear.</p>
   <p>Equity-invested affluent professionals tend stereotypically to be "fiscally conservative". If the dynamic I conjecture above is correct, well, careful what you wish for.</p>
   <p>Share prices and government deficits are connected conventionally via the <a href="https://www.levyforecast.com/assets/Profits.pdf">Levy-Kalecki profit equation</a>. (ht <a href="https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/where-do-profits-come-from">Nathan Tankus</a>) But that effect produces no expansion of valuation: share prices grow because profits grow. The dynamic described here leaves deficits not only padding corporate profits, but also supercharging multiples, whenever government debt is growing faster than earnings. Deficit restraint would both impair corporate cash flows, and reduce cash injections that investors now rely upon to deliver share price increases via portfolio composition effects.</p>
   <p>One puzzle (to me at least) has been why high share valuations have been so resilient as we've transitioned from near-zero interest rates to short-term rates above 5%. I had, calamitously, expected share prices would not be so resilient. But if portfolio composition trumps valuation, then we should expect high interest rates to be good for share prices over the long run, despite short-term declines when raises are first announced. Interest rate cuts, by reducing fiscal injections, should be bad for stock prices over time, despite price spikes when markets first anticipate them.</p>
   <p>David Andolfatto has <a href="https://andolfatto.blogspot.com/2024/02/does-high-interest-policy-constitute.html">recently pointed out</a> that the short-run and long-run effects of interest rate changes can be quite distinct. Perhaps <em>ex ante</em> the stock market reacts through a zombie reflex discounted-cash-flow valuation channel, but <em>ex post</em>, once the cash actually flows — or does not! — the aggregate investor's thirst to conjure its desired asset allocation wins out.</p>

   <p>Since not long after Donald Trump was elected in 2016, there has been this <a href="https://www.democraticunderground.com/?com=view_post&amp;forum=1002&amp;pid=10905966">meme</a> <a href="https://www.benjaminlcorey.com/who-would-you-have-been-in-nazi-germany-the-same-person-you-are-now/">going</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeActRadio/posts/if-youve-ever-wondered-what-you-would-do-during-the-rise-of-nazi-germany-well-no/2854473587935899/">'round</a> among liberals, something to the effect of "If you've ever wondered what you would do during the rise of Nazi Germany, it is what you are doing right now."</p>
   <p>The implication, of course, is that Trumpism and the fascism lurking just beneath it places us in a position analogous to Germans in say 1933.</p>
   <p>I have no argument with the point. There is something to it.</p>
   <p>However, it is at best a kind of loose analogy. It's pattern matching deployed to persuade people of the moral stakes of our situation, and to identify which actors are right, and which are much worse than merely wrong.</p>
   <p>Germany (or German-occupied Poland) in <em>1943</em> rather than 1933 presents an even more morally evocative touchstone for comparisons.</p>
   <p><em>If you've ever wondered what you would do during the rise of Nazi Germany, it is what you are doing right now.</em></p>
   <p>In Gaza, trapped innocents are being killed in large numbers.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the comparison is unfair. The Nazis never tried to warn their victims with pamphlets and "roof knocking" to get out of harms way. Hamas provoked the current conflict with mass atrocity in ways the Jews of Germany never did. No country could be expected simply to tolerate an enclave ruled by terrorists who openly promise to repeat their atrocities again and again and again.</p>
   <p>All of that is true.</p>
   <p>Trumpists of course can also draw a lot of true and important distinctions between their movement and the actual literal Nazis of Germany 1933.</p>
   <p>The power of the analogy is to cut through the nuance and expose it as sophistry. This will always seem unfair when you are on the side whose defense requires nuance.</p>
   <p>Whether in God's eye the nuanced position is right or wrong, here on Earth moral intuitions are blunt instruments. Generally people will side with a penned-in defenseless population getting murdered, regardless of the bigger picture. As a heuristic, that doesn't seem so terrible.</p>
   <p><em>If you've ever wondered what you would do during the rise of Nazi Germany, it is what you are doing right now.</em></p>
   <p>People who make these kinds of remarks seem so certain they know who the Nazis are. But it could be us, too. The Nazis didn't think they were the Nazis, in the way we mean it now. Whenever we consider ourselves part of a group so inherently righteous we are immune, we become particularly susceptible to slipping into the role.</p>
