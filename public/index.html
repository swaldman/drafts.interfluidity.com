   <p>Joe Biden is the best domestic-policy president of my lifetime.</p>
   <p>I wasn't expecting that, but his administration has <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/11/30/obama-was-the-most-destructive-political-figure-of-my-lifetime/index.html">defied my expectations</a>. I would like for him to be re-elected. I am hungry for him to be re-elected.</p>
   <p>I am very angry with Joe Biden as a foreign-policy president. Biden's foreign policy has made it difficult for me to support his re-election in the public and full-throated way that I would like to. Yes, when the alternative is Trump, Biden remains easily the better choice, even on foreign policy, on moral as well as practical grounds. But I am not at all happy with the Biden administration on foreign policy. I am chastened by my own moral vanity when I speak too highly of the person who has presided over the United States' policy with respect to Israel and Gaza.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, you should vote for Joe Biden. Vote for Joe Biden.</p>
   <p>I think a lot of people who share my electoral politics are making a terrible mistake. I will mock it as the "America Is Already Great" mistake, after Hillary Clinton's response to MAGA. A lot of center-left economics pundits are telling us this is a great, fantastic, economy, and that's why we should elect Joe Biden. America is already great.</p>
   <p>This is not a great, fantastic, economy. I was going to hang this post on an article by Rogé Karma, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/us-economy-excellent/678630/"><em>The U.S. Economy Reaches Superstar Status</em></a>, which pretends to "ask how [the economy is] objectively performing". There was lots I could object to in the piece. But Karma gets it basically right in the end. (Of course!)</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Indeed, the out-of-control cost of housing is perhaps the biggest black mark on an otherwise excellent economy. This problem started decades ago—since the 1980s, the median U.S. home price has increased by more than 400 percent, twice as fast as incomes—and got even worse during the pandemic, as the rise of remote work prompted millions of people to seek more space. Those rising prices have collided with higher interest rates to produce the most punishing housing market in at least a generation. Would-be homeowners can’t afford to buy, and many existing homeowners feel stuck in place.</p>
    <p>Housing is one of several crucial categories, along with childcare, health care, and higher education, that have ballooned in cost in recent decades, putting a middle-class lifestyle further and further out of reach—what my colleague Annie Lowrey has called the “Great Affordability Crisis.” The past few years of high interest rates, which make borrowing money more expensive, have jacked up costs even more. And despite the recent good news, the U.S. still has lower life expectancy and much higher levels of inequality, poverty, and homelessness than other wealthy nations. For millions of people, getting by in America was a struggle before the pandemic and continues to be a struggle today.</p>
    <p>Still, that doesn’t change the fact that the U.S. economy has had a remarkable four-year run, judged against both its own history or the international competition. A few years of good news isn’t enough to make up for 40 years of rising inequality and stagnant wages. But it’s a whole lot better than the alternative.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Professional-class pundits are used to talking about the economy in cyclical terms. We're not in a recession! Unemployment is down! The stock market is up! GDP numbers are up! <em>This is a good economy</em>, by definition, right?</p>
   <p>No. What matters most is how the economy shapes lives and societies over time. Presidential performance is a secular, not cyclical, concern. We should not vote for President based on whether, by some bit of luck or manipulation, unemployment numbers hit a new low or the S&amp;P a new high just before the election. Presidents should not emulate the idiot CEOs who have eviscerated our economy by imagining there is a number — hard data! — that is a sufficient statistic for their performance. A President's job is to see through the cycles and shape a better future. In my view, Joe Biden has made an excellent start at that.</p>
   <p>But what is secular takes time to bear fruit. Joe Biden has just begun, <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">imperfectly but hopefully</a>, to reinvigorate America's industrial policy. The right way to promote this is the honest one: Big, important changes have been initiated in the structure of the American economy, but it will be too soon on November 5 to know how this experiment works out. The experiment includes dramatically strengthening labor unions, using subsidies and when necessary even tariffs to reshore critical industries, muscular antitrust enforcement that aims to undo concentrations of economic power and ensure vigorous competition. If the experiment is allowed to continue, it will also include higher taxes on the wealthy (as the Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire for very high earners).</p>
   <p>The question before voters is whether this experiment should be allowed to continue, or whether it should be aborted.</p>
   <p>There's that story, undoubtedly apocryphal, where V. Lenin says, "After the revolution, there will be strawberries and cream for everyone." His interlocutor responds, <em>But Comrade Lenin, what if I don't like strawberries and cream?</em> Lenin replies, "After the revolution, you <em>will</em> like strawberries and cream."</p>
   <p>That's what all the rhetoric trying to "convince ordinary people" that this is really, <em>objectively</em>, a great economy feels like to me.</p>
   <p>The question of whether an economy is good is as "objective" as your preference for strawberries and cream. What matters for the economy, overall and longer term, is as well captured in the moment's economic statistics as GE's quality of management was captured in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE/chart/#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-">its August 2000 share price</a>.</p>
   <p>There's no such thing as "objectively good". We don't all share the same values. We have radically diverse views about what a better future would look like. I want a prosperous future for us and so does Peter Thiel, but the shape of the worlds we aspire towards, what would count as prosperity, diverge. Some ways that the economy might "grow" bring the world towards Thiel's vision, others towards my own. Any delta between the GDP numbers of those growings is not the thing that matters.</p>
   <p>Expansion is most of the business cycle. We spent the majority of the last forty years in a "growing economy". Most economists, most of the time, would have characterized it as a "good economy".</p>
   <p>What did all that good economy, in a cyclical sense, compose to as a secular matter? A world that is <a href="https://www.leftanchor.com/e/episode-170-unlocked-america-is-pottersville/">Pottersville, not Bedford Falls</a>. A world in which the "successes" who buy our media companies and endow our universities are con men and predators, rather than people who produce more and better and cheaper goods and services. A world in which it's hard not to juxtapose a booming stock market — yay! — with relentlessly expanding profit margins, companies "too big to care" (as Lina Khan memorably put it), private equity rolling up medical imaging and shutting down Red Lobster while <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/23/spineless/">blaming shrimp generosity</a> rather than <a href="https://aramzs.xyz/noteworthy/what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster/">sale-leaseback financial engineering</a>.</p>
   <p>The American economy is dystopian, secularly. I agree that the Biden post-COVID cycle has not been so bad, has been pretty good along a variety of dimensions, although <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/index.html">not as good</a> as boosters protest too hard to claim.</p>
   <p>That's a point of light in a bowl of shit. If the people who are speaking on Joe Biden's behalf keep missing that, don't be surprised if voters go with the other guy. As Ian Welsh <a href="https://www.ianwelsh.net/le-pen-is-delusional-but-macron-deserves-to-lose/">put it today</a></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>This is the Brexit/Trump/Javier problem. To whit, when things are bad for a long time and nothing seems to help, people reach [for] something extreme. They know the status quo isn’t working and that things keep getting worse no matter who they vote for among the mainstream, so they look for someone or something completely different. Trump is a billionaire, but he doesn’t parse the same as normal politicians.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Don't sabotage Joe Biden's chances by making him out to be a normal politician. He's the only politician since Lyndon Johnson to begin to seriously try something different. Biden may "parse the same as normal politicians", but on questions of economy and society, he has been much more ambitious, much more bold, much more different than Donald Trump. He may be a fragile, senile, old man who farts on stage, but he's done the policy equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger benching 500 pounds.</p>
   <p>Credit him with that. Don't damn him with the faint praise of labor market leverage already beginning to fade, meager "real wage" growth against tiny baselines, stock market performance that mostly helps plutocrats and the professional class that they employ, housing "wealth" that for all of us who do not own a home represents a crushing liability.</p>
   <hr>
   <p>p.s. I want to dedicate a great deal more than this post to <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/obituaries/psar0822496">Eugene Lewis</a>, who told me the Lenin tall tale.</p>

 <div class="entry-body">
  <p>We've all seen this wonderful <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon by <a href="https://twitter.com/WillMcPhail/status/815899174474567680">Will McPhail</a>:</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2022/12/new-yorker-pilot.jpg" width="100%"></p>
  <p>There are real tensions between democracy and technocracy. The cartoon shows an example where, in fact, technocracy should rule. The people should defer to the experts.</p>
  <p>But if you think of yourself as pro-democracy, I hope you <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7317.html">thought the question through</a> a bit more than "Ha ha, take that MAGA blowhards!"</p>
  <p>If you think of yourself as a small-d democrat, you should recognize that there are serious tensions between democracy and technocracy. Democracy is based on the notion that everyone should have a say in how affairs are governed, because no one other than each and every one of us for ourselves has authority in deciding what ends we should pursue. Technocracy justifies itself by pointing out, accurately, that the broad public is incapable of devising means that will actually achieve its desired ends. You need experts for that.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, distinctions between means and ends blur in practice. We all share many values, but we weigh them quite differently. Experts can, and too often do, quietly presuppose a prioritization of values — and therefore of ends — that would reinforce their own status and role, and then demand deference as they move on to prescribing means.</p>
  <p>During the financial crisis, once "financial stability" was the priority — rather than keeping people in their homes, or winding down and replacing pernicious institutions, or ensuring distributive justice — then of course we had to listen to bankers as to means. Who else understood the plumbing of the system we were stabilizing? Such a shock, then, that the means the best experts offered involved bailing out banks and their creditors while squeezing debtors with mortgages.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/opinion/covid-fauci-hearings-health.html">continuing COVID</a> fight between "listen to the science" Blue America and <i>Plandemic</i> Red America is really a proxy war over whether disease minimization should have been the overwhelming priority, or ends like personal liberty and supporting commerce should have weighed more heavily in the mix. The public health community predictably presumed that preventing disease should be the overwhelming priority. (Predictably, since that is both a reasonable choice, and the choice that would maximize its own status and scope for discretion. I certainly agreed. I still do!)</p>
  <p>The public health community didn't mean to enter partisan politics. But unlike bankers, who very much did mean to take control in their own interest, public health will see its status and perhaps its funding diminished going forward, because it is now perceived by much of the country not as a neutral arbiter of facts and evidence, but as a usurper of discretion that properly belongs to the democratic public. We will all, unfortunately, be even less prepared when the next public health crisis hits. (I hope <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/06/bird-flu-swine-flu-2009-which-is-worse/678620/">not soon</a>.)</p>
  <p>It is good that members of a democratic public jealously guard their right to have opinions and to have them heard on questions of ends. The public ought to be suspicious of technocratic claims that circumscribe their ability to assert agency over public affairs. Expert communities really do snow the public, all the time. (I don't know whether COVID was lab-leak or zoonotic, but I think the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/the-lab-leak-theory-inside-the-fight-to-uncover-covid-19s-origins">case is pretty strong</a> that expert communities put their thumb on the scale early on in favor of zoonotic, in part to protect parochial interests.) But if the public becomes so allergic that we never defer to expertise, well, then bridges will collapse and planes will crash and all of our medicines will be snake oil.</p>
  <p>Democracy places an ethical demand upon experts that they on the whole are failing to meet. That demand is radical humility. It is human — and career-advancing — to play up ones abilities and accomplishments. Many of us quietly believe that if we had more say in how things are run, things would be run much better. Humility just at the moment when you might make a difference is a hard ask. But key to an expert's job is to actively minimize the scope of their claim to authority. When communicating with the public or with political figures, they must strive to impose the narrowest set of constraints their expertise will allow, because their duty is to support, not to gainsay or foreclose, the democratic public's discretion.</p>
  <p>Legitimate authority derives not from expertise alone, but from expertise in <i>service</i> of the democratic public. If you intend to wield your expertise as an activist, if you learned about climate science to change the world, great. Present yourself as an informed advocate, make your case to the democratic public, educate, convince, try to help them understand things as you do.</p>
  <p>But if you demand deference, if you claim that by virtue of superior knowledge, failing to adopt your policy positions is failing to "follow the science", then you are mixing the roles of expert and advocate. The name for people who do that is "hack". The prevalence of hacks in this sense — on cable TV, in think tanks, on social media, even among <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2018/03/30/importance-being-scholar-activist-opinion">well-meaning scholars</a> — has replaced a lot of public trust in experts with earned hostility. How are you supposed to feel about people who are actively disenfrachising you?</p>
  <p>Expertise can be a resource to a democracy. It can be the weapon of a faction. But it cannot be both at the same time.</p>
  <p>You can be both a citizen with an opinion and an expert with knowledge that less knowledgeable people should defer to. But you must keep those roles distinct. As an expert, you must present the largest space possible of options that might under <i>anyone's</i> values be reasonable to pursue. You must report, to the best of your abilities, the consequences and uncertainties surrounding each option without fear or favor. Even when that means people whom you think are terrible might get their way.</p>
  <p>If you put your thumb on the scale, if you present as authoritative claims that are tailored to further your own contestable priorities — however virtuous your priorities may in fact be! — you are heightening the contradictions between democracy and expert authority. You are tacitly making the case that meaningful democracy is impractical, and therefore one form or another of authoritarianism is inevitable.</p>
  <p>No, <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon, the democratic public should not try to fly the plane. But the pilot, for his part, must fly it to the place the passengers contracted to go.</p>
  <p>If some kind of science fiction catastrophe were to occur, and the plane must divert to a final destination from which rebooking will not be an option, then taking a vote of the passengers would absolutely be the right thing to do. If, when the pilot presents the destinations they have fuel enough to reach, she leaves out places she would disprefer... Well, she might get away with it! Or she might not.</p>
  <p>Regardless, it would be a sin.</p>

   <p>Towards the end of a generally excellent piece on housing, Hamilton Nolan <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/housing-is-the-economy">writes</a></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[I]f your response to that is “hey let’s just build public housing units for all 400,000 people,” that sure sounds nice, but brother I am here to tell you that there are only 177,000 total NYC public housing units right now, and that represents the sum total of all that have been produced in the city’s history, and they don’t even fund the ones that exist adequately right now. So practically speaking, saying “just build public housing” is the equivalent of saying “just give everyone magical castles.” It is a nice goal but it ain’t happening any time soon and in the meantime, everyone needs affordable housing. To reiterate: the only long term path to bringing housing prices down to an affordable level is by building enough housing supply to meet total demand. Build more. Much more.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I fully endorse that last bit. <em>The only long term path to bringing housing prices down to an affordable level is by building enough housing supply to meet total demand. Build more. Much more.</em></p>
   <p>Indeed.</p>
   <p>But I disendorse Nolan's attitude regarding public housing. State-led development is the only solution to our housing catastrophe. We will figure that out, sooner or later. We will be much better off if we can figure it out sooner.</p>
   <p>The problem with YIMBY-ness has never been that YIMBYs are wrong to focus on housing scarcity in places people want to live as perhaps the most destructive economic ill we face. They are right about that!</p>
   <p>Their error has always been a pollyanna-ish idea that <em>if only</em> we would lift legal constraints we can easily understand to be unjust — exclusionary zoning whose roots are in racial segregation! — private markets would just resolve this problem and we would all be okay.</p>
   <p>But NIMBY-ness, as Nolan perceptively describes earlier in the piece, is endogenous to prosperous density:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>In cities where many people want to live, but which fail to build enough new housing every year to keep up with demand, housing prices rapidly reach levels only affordable to the rich. The middle class leaves the expensive cities. They move to less expensive cities, where they constitute an influx of new residents, and they are resented by the existing residents of those cities, who see their own housing prices rise as a result of the influx. Instead of rapidly building a lot of new housing to account for the influx, residents typically channel their resentment into a determination to keep everything as it is, which means a continuing lack of adequate new housing construction, which only serves to drive up rents and home prices further. And the cycle continues, from one city to the next to the next. People leave San Francisco because it’s too expensive and they move to Denver and then they make Denver too expensive and then those people move to Boise and make Boise too expensive and then those people move to your small town. Uh oh! You will teach them a lesson, by organizing your neighbors to fight against the damn new luxury condo building they want to build downtown. Eventually your town will become too expensive as well.</p>
    <p>We need to build more housing. If your city is too expensive it is because there is not enough housing to meet the demand. Build more housing. Stop being selfish.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Note that your town doesn't need to already have zoning laws historically rooted in racial segregation. It will invent them, or it will invent something else, because the people who bought homes they love in neighborhoods they love, upon whose character they have based their security and lifestyle, into whose financial value they have leveraged their net worth several times over, will not stand for leaving those assets to the vicissitudes of private home developers.</p>
   <p>And then there are basic facts of physics and geography. Infill of existing density is challenging and costly. Infrastructure must be retrofit. Even if eventually there will be room for so many more, current residents may need to be displaced (and in practice often never become part of that many more). Greenfields grow ever more distant from the drivers of demand. Together, these factors <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1540-6229.12490">render housing supply curves "convex"</a>. (ht <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/what-does-it-look-like-to-build-more-housing.html">Tyler Cowen</a>) In English, what that means is that price increases translate less and less to housing quantity increases as metropolitan areas grow, regardless of the regulatory regime.</p>
   <p>When you are trying to rely upon the market to solve your problem, and then your advice is "stop being selfish", perhaps you should <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/george-packer/end-of-an-era-2-greenspans-world-view-fails-him">encounter the wisdom of Alan Greenspan</a></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>I made a mistake in presuming that...self-interests...were best capable... I have found a flaw. I don’t know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Private markets are based on selfishness. This idea that developers will be motivated by avarice to do just what you want, but homeowners must suspend avariciousness with respect to the asset at the very core of their lives? Good luck with that.</p>
   <p>The YIMBY movement has succeeded, like Max Weber's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/70587-politics-is-a-strong-and-slow-boring-of-hard-boards">proverbial</a> strong and <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/yimbys-keep-winning">slow boring</a> of hard boards, in making some real progress in some particular places. I will concede that, between <a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-and-research/accessory-dwelling-units">liberalization of ADU construction</a> and the astonishing "<a href="https://smdp.com/2024/04/03/californias-most-controversial-housing-law-could-get-a-makeover/">builder's remedy</a>", California has gone farther than I ever imagined it would towards coercing localities to build even against strong opposition of local government's best enfranchised constituents. It isn't nothing. It's a quite extraordinary political achievement. And I don't doubt that it helps, at the margin, for a while.</p>
   <p>But the core problem we face is much bigger than land-use. It is geographic inequality. We have created a country in which too few patches of geography are associated with vastly better opportunities and amenities than all the other places. As with individual inequality, some of this is "natural". Some people are taller than other people, and will have better chances in the NBA. Some places are lovelier and more temperate than other places. However, the actual inequality we are struggling with is not due primarily to these differences, but to our social arrangements. There are plenty of lovely places in the United States that could host remarkable and desirable cities. That they don't is a social outcome, not the result of any natural law.</p>
   <p>So long as just a few places offer so much more amenity, liveliness, and economic opportunity than everywhere else, supply growth in those already built-out places will nowhere near match the tsunami of demand they face from people who would migrate there if they could. The deep flaw in YIMBY-ism is that problem they accurately highlight is orders of magnitude larger than what the solutions they identify, promote, and support can plausibly address. Yet the medicine they propose is divisive and painful to people in established, lived communities, and tend to serve the better-off in favor of the worse-off, as market-based solutions usually do. Regulatory caveats intended to counter gentrification, exhortations to upzone places that are affluent and coveted rather than communities poorer and already precarious are well and good. But they cannot overcome the basic physics of market action, <em>to each according to his purchasing power, from each according to his desperation</em>.</p>
   <p>Even if YIMBYs got all the legal reform they wanted, if all residential construction was by-right and developers had free reign, it's not at all clear housing abundance would result. We've already discussed the factors that overdetermine "convex supply curves", under any regulatory regime. Then there are economic factors beyond regulation. The YIMBY dream is that, if regulatory constraints were lifted, swarms of home developers would engage in ruinous competition to build, driving down the price of the goods they produce and sell. In our contemporary, highly consolidated, economy, how many industries work like this?</p>
   <p>Let's hear from <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/why-we-cant-build-our-way-out-of-this-hot-housing-market/">Logan Mohtashami of HousingWire</a>, whom I think it is fair to characterize as a perpetual bull on the US private sector:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Unless the government steps in to build when new home sales demand gets soft, we will not add homes to the builders’ demand algorithm. Builders have learned to tightly control inventory by retreating from construction when demand becomes slack. Building more homes is bad business during weaker times... We won’t see the construction boom that people want because the builders are here to make money; they’re not here to fix the low inventory issues of the existing home sales market, which is their main rival for demand.</p>
    <p>This is why I have stressed before if you want a construction boom, the federal government will need to step in with deficit financing.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>In general, firms prefer to produce small quantities at high prices, rather than large quantities at low prices, if they can get away with it. For now, for the most part, they get away with it. If you want to be a YIMBY optimist, you have to hope not only for <em>ixnaying</em> exclusionary zoning and environmental reviews and all of that malarky. You will need Lina Khan's very devoted attention to your municipality, in a domain which by its nature is unusually prone to consolidation. Urban construction always requires locality-specific capabilities and connections, and the people who have those are susceptible to being bought out. (I know. Don't be selfish.)</p>
   <p>What YIMBYs get wrong is the actual nature of the scarcity they need to overcome. You cannot, will not, overcome the scarcity of San Francisco. What you can overcome is the scarcity of <em>San Franciscoes</em>. If you create more demand drivers, more places where it becomes desirable to live, where important <a href="https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1256&amp;context=reports">agglomeration effects</a> take hold, you reset the picture. All of a sudden, there are greenfields very near your demand driver, which you can develop at efficient density without colonizing established neighborhoods. Eventually, established neighborhoods in older desirable places will redevelop themselves, in ways their own selfish residents determine, as desirable alternatives elsewhere become competitive threats.</p>
   <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-forever-promises-new-solano-county-investments/"><em>California Forever</em></a> notwithstanding, the private sector is not going to throw around capital in sufficient quantity to invest in places where there's not already a good business case to build — that is, where there's not already an obvious, preexisting demand driver.</p>
   <p>One of my favorite paragraphs I ever wrote is <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6846.html">this one</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>It’s a cliché that the government builds “bridges to nowhere” that the private sector never would build. That’s true. And it’s a credit to the public sector. Bridges to nowhere are what turn nowheres into somewheres. We need many, many more bridges to nowhere.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Turning nowheres into somewheres is a role of the state. It is not an easy role, by any measure. Of course there have been, and will be, failures, boondoggles. You could have tens of billions of dollars worth of boondoggle annually and it wouldn't measure anywhere near the social cost of housing dysfunction in the contemporary United States. All successful enterprises involve failures along the way, and until we <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">develop public sector institutions more tolerant of that</a>, we'll continue to impoverish ourselves and fall behind in geopolitical competition.</p>
   <p>If you want to know how I propose we build, read <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8772.html"><em>Microcities</em></a>.</p>
   <p>But of course there are a wide variety of possible approaches, and people much, much smarter than I am thinking about this. Before you come at me with your pessimism, yes, Milton Keynes was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/03/struggle-for-the-soul-of-milton-keynes">tragically conceived</a> at the height of automotive exuberance and there are things we should regret about it. But it is a <a href="https://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/news/people/milton-keynes-chosen-for-sunday-times-best-place-to-live-guide-for-first-time-ever-4554727">broadly successful metropolis now</a>. Ordos, China's most famous "ghost city", is booming after the Chinese state <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Society/China-s-largest-ghost-city-booms-again-thanks-to-education-fever">intervened</a> with the "artificial" demand driver of placing competitive schools there.</p>
   <p>States can do these things.</p>
   <p>Neither Milton Keynes nor Ordos strike me as good models to emulate. But in their imperfection they remind us, cities can be made. Even when made not so well, they can thrive, become fine places to live and work. Next time, we'll make them better.</p>
   <p>New cities can house people. And they will, sooner or later.</p>
   <p>In 2018, Saoirse Gowan and Ryan Cooper wrote <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/project/a-plan-to-solve-the-housing-crisis-through-social-housing/"><em>A Plan to Solve the Housing Crisis Through Social Housing</em></a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Sweden, which undertook perhaps the most aggressive public housing plan of any country relative to its size, provides one high-water mark. The Swedish government set a goal of building 1 million new units in the mid-1960s when the population was only 8 million (or about the same size as New York City). Despite a few setbacks and problems, this goal was achieved in less than a decade – indeed it was so successful that Sweden had an oversupply of affordable housing for decades afterward.</p>
    <p>We suggest that 10 million new municipal housing units would be a viable 10-year goal. That is well short of a scaled-up version of the Swedish program, but still quite aggressive. We do not anticipate a U.S. affordable housing oversupply being a significant risk in the medium term.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I know, right? Laugh. In America, we know social housing as public housing, as <em>the projects</em> and we know how that goes. We have not built 10M new units.</p>
   <p>The problem of housing scarcity has only grown worse. As Nolan reminds us, what was once a pathology of San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, has metastasized. Boise has become aspirational too. I'd argue that this is the main reason why younger people (some older ones too!) are pessimistic about the US economy. Housing in the places people want to live is impossibly expensive. The dream of a chill, secure middle-class life in a safe and lively place with good schools is out of reach.</p>
   <p>So far, the housing apocalypse has been a boiling-frog game of musical chairs. The housing situation has worsened in increments, and the losers each round have been the least well-off. That is precisely the sort of problem the American political system is built to ignore. We blame the losers, and segregate ourselves from them. (Until, of course, we find it is our turn to lose.)</p>
   <p>But climate shocks are already beginning to change this. Well enfranchised, safely middle-class Americans are going to find themselves uprooted from homes they purchased as the foundation of their security, some directly by catastrophe, most by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/climate/insurance-homes-climate-change-weather.html">burgeoning insurance costs</a>. We are already in a phase of socialized denial, which we have institutionalized into state-backed insurers of last resort. Very soon, we will see one of those insurers outmatched by nature. Bailouts will be arranged.</p>
   <p>From that moment on, the fiscal calculus will have turned. State-led housing development will no longer be a matter of handouts to losers, supported out of self-regarding pity by liberals, subject to criticism and derision by conservatives. State-led development will be the only means we have of rehousing millions of hard-working families over a limited period of time. Our ability to do it well — to construct new, safer, places where people will genuinely want to live — will go a long way to deciding whether our collective future is dark or bright.</p>
   <p>"Social housing" is not a pie-in-the-sky project. It's an inevitability. We already face a deep and terrible housing crisis. The time to get good at building new communities, to exercise state capacity we will desperately need, to experiment and endure failures we must learn from, is right now.</p>

   <p>A thing I think people get wrong is this idea people love Trump because they think he's a winner. They'd walk away if only he can be revealed for the loser he really is.</p>
   <p>I think people like Trump because they know he's a loser like they often are made to feel they are too. Donald Trump is obviously a loser. But he's a loser who wins anyway, who is rich and famous and drives all the asshole winners fucking mad.</p>
   <p>That's why the weird apocalyptic "I am your retribution" talk works. He is the dick you don’t really want to be, but that you would be if you set your resentments and anger free. His fight is, in that sense, your fight. Most of us are losers in a winner-take-all society.</p>
   <p>The fascist aesthetic worships indomitable strength and the power to smite, sure. But people do not worship what is already theirs. They worship what they yearn to have. Fascists emphasize masculinity and <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/28/masculine-virtues/index.html">masculine virtues</a>, but haven't you met these people? Do you listen to their podcasts? Are they self-assured and self-reliant? Disciplined?

He does not submit to the humilations we submit to, when we endure a really empathetic conversation with HR about how our remark was not up to the standards we are trying to uphold at this company.

  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>My friend Chris Peel recently did <a href="https://github.com/chrisvwx/taxFoo.jl">a deep dive into US Federal income tax schedules</a>. He computed effective tax rates by inflation-adjusted income for years 1862 to 2024, taking into account the standard deduction. I thought it'd be fun to visualize his results, and it's proven to be an interesting exercise.</p>
   <p>First, here's the full history of effective US tax rates as a single surface.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-surface-with-std-deduction-front-south-east.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-surface-with-std-deduction-front-south-east.png" alt="Surface graph of US effective tax rates, 1862-2024"></a></p>
   <p>Click for a larger view! Or play with an <a href="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/2b0afc69-4a37-439f-998c-ac3b55d4fec2">interactive version</a> online!</p>
   <p>Our data is rates for married households, filing jointly. The numbers are computed from ordinary income rates only, so they will be overstated for high-income households, who enjoy a great deal of tax-advantaged capital income. All dollar amounts are CPI-adjusted 2024 dollars.</p>
   <hr>
   <p>What stood out immediately to me in this graph is the constancy at the middle. Since the World War II peak, rates have collapsed at the high end and at the low end. At middle incomes? Not so much.</p>
   <p>Let's take a look at the same information as cross-sections by income.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1862-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1862-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1862-2024"></a></p>
   <p>Now let's zoom into the post-war period. We'll begin in 1945, when the US had its highest income tax rates, from which they have subsequently collapsed.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1945-2024"></a></p>
   <p>I think it's helpful to divide this picture into four categories:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Ultra high income: income ($10M, $100M)</li>
    <li>High income: ($500K, $1M)</li>
    <li>Middle income: ($63K, $100K, $200K)</li>
    <li>Low income: $10K</li>
   </ul>
   <p>(As of 2022, the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S1903">median income for married couples</a> was about $109,000. Assuming, conservatively, it has remained constant in inflation-adjusted terms, that would be $115,000 dollars today. Real median income has grown over time, and we'll want to encompass a bit above the median, so we let the range from $63K to $200K 2024 dollars represent our "middle".)</p>
   <p>The first lesson here is that <em>income tax policy has been least important for the middle-income group</em>. There's just a lot less variation at $63K, $100K, and $200K levels than at levels above and below.</p>

   </div> A second lesson, which was entirely new to me until Chris pointed it out, is that for low-income people, the crucial tax reform happened in 1970, under Richard Nixon! 
   <p><a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/file/182549/download?token=IeifAYsd">From 1944-1969</a> the standard deduction was defined as 10% of income to a maximum of $1000. That meant that, then and now, the standard deduction did very little for high-income earners. But before 1970, it also did very little for low-income earners. In 1970, the standard deduction became defined as a fixed amount, which meant that people with very low incomes could deduct everything. A fixed-amount standard deduction renders the effective income tax very progressive at low incomes, but its influence fades as incomes rise.</p>

   <p>A third lesson is just how terrible JFK's tax cuts were, for those of us who believe that democracy and a decent society depend upon preventing plutocratic wealth accumulation. Between 1963 and 1965, effective tax rates paid by $100M earners dropped by 20 percentage point, while a middle-income earner making $100K (in 2024 dollars) saw relief of 4 to 5 percentage points.</p>
   <p>A fourth lesson is that the period 1965 to 1980 was a political economy catastrophe. There were no tax increases on ultra-high-income earners during the period, but ordinary high-income earners saw their tax burden steadily rise.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1965-1980.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1965-1980.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1965-1980"></a></p>
   <p>Ordinary high-income earners represent a very important group of people. They are most successful professionals, influential in society and much more numerous than ultra-high-income earners. This is the group that actually peoples the commanding heights of the economy and the media. Raising taxes on this group while holding plutocratic earners harmless was a terrible own goal. It delivered very little of the main benefit of progressive taxation (preventing plutocratic wealth accumulation!) while it sewed the seeds for a tax revolt.</p>
   <p>The tax policy of this period was not calibrated to win the hearts and minds of middle-income earners. Lower-middle-income earners did enjoy some tax relief, but upper-middle-income earners endured increases, the middle-middle was basically flat. I suspect the dumb policy was motivated fiscal revenue accounting. Increasing rates on high-income earners delivers revenue, while ultra-high-income earners avoided their much higher taxes by not realizing personal income.</p>
   <p>But financing the government is not about revenue in accounting terms. It depends on the disinflationary impulse that taxation provokes. Taxing high earners is less disinflationary, serves to finance spending less effectively, than taxing people lower in the income scale. Because affluent people's marginal dollar of income is usually saved rather than spent, taxing it does not reduce spending. So the additional revenue was largely fruitless. The additional resentment, however, made fertile ground from which a terrible flower would soon blossom.</p>
   <p><a href="https://x.com/interfluidity/status/1092519956439130112">Billionaire politics</a> is about making human shields of the merely affluent.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-1988.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-1988.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1980-1988"></a></p>
   <p>A fifth lesson is that Ronald Reagan's tax policy was horrendous, and is largely still with us today.</p>
   <p>Those high-income earners who had grown resentful of their tax burden, which had been steadily increasing since the mid-sixties? They finally got their, um, retribution. Ultra-high-income earners, who had suffered no increase at all, hitched a ride on this tax revolution by affluent professionals and won the biggest rate cuts of all.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile lower-middle-income earners saw their rates <em>rise</em> over the period. What the fuck was the matter with Kansas?</p>
   <p>George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton undid only about a quarter of the damage Reagan had done. Not to mention JFK.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-2000.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-2000.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1980-2000"></a></p>
   <p>And that is the world in which we continue to live. Post Y2K, rates fluctuate, but rates on ultra-high-income earners have basically been flat.</p>
   <p>Middle income rates rarely move much. But grading on a curve, cosidering the narrow range over which middle income rates do fluctuate, the tax cuts under George W. Bush and Trump did yield middle income tax relief. This relief has stuck, as only high and ulta-high income rates reverted under Obama, and nothing much has changed over Biden.</p>
   <p>While I'm sure it's true, in dollar terms, that the overwhelming majority of the 2017 tax cuts go to very high earners, Trump, unlike Ronald Reagan, did actually deliver at least a little to people at middle incomes.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-2000-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-2000-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 2000-2024"></a></p>
   <p>(Low income effective rates have been flat at zero throught the period. If you are wondering where the $10K line is, it may be hidden by the x-axis.)</p>
   <p>Pulling back, the overarching story is simple:</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1945-2024"></a></p>
   <p>Since World War II, US Federal income tax rates have fallen at every level. At middle incomes, they've deflated only modestly. But under the Kennedy and Reagan administrations, rates on ultra-high-income earners were demolished, in acts of social vandalism that have yet to be undone.</p>
   <p>By throwing just a few small chicken bones to higher-income professionals and the middle class, mad occultists opened a portal to resurgent plutocracy. You can feel its dark wings thumping. We are <a href="https://x.com/">living</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">with</a> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/barre-seid-heartland-institute-hillsdale-college-gmu">the</a> <a href="https://secure.winred.com/trump-national-committee-jfc/lp-ads-guilty-verdict-google/">consequences</a>.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it's time we reseal the portal.</p>
