  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>The United States is no longer a liberal democracy.</p>
   <p>As of Monday, July 1st, 2024 and the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>, the United States fails liberal democracy's most basic test. Citizens no longer have rights against the state that cannot be abrogated without due process, because presidential prerogatives are granted priority above due process and rendered immune from challenge by the courts.</p>
   <p>The Supreme Court has legislated a loophole through the constraints on presidential power that is so large, so conveniently and readily accessible, that all notional limits to government power can be circumvented by a determined President, with almost no risk of being held accountable.</p>
   <p>In a nutshell, the decision claims that the President has "conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority" over "commanding the Armed Forces of the United States" and "pardons for offenses against the United States".</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>A President, the decision pretends, remains accountable for "unofficial acts". For "official acts" beyond his "conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority", the President enjoys "at least a presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility."</p>
   <p>In theory, this "presumptive immunity" can be rebutted, overcome, but</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such a “highly intrusive” inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose... Nor may courts deem an action unofficial merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>This decision is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-says-the-presidents-power-will-not-be-questioned/2017/02/13/0f772184-f14f-11e6-9fb1-2d8f3fc9c0ed_video.html">Stephen Miller</a>, translated into legalese:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Our opponents, the media, and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions that the powers of the President... are very substantial and will not be questioned. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Commanding the armed forces plus the pardon power, if unaccountable and unreviewable, are sufficient to impose dictatorship.</p>
   <p>"Can't you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something?", Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1097517470/trump-esper-book-defense-secretary">asked</a> of General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley, when protesters gathered at the White House following the killing of George Floyd.</p>
   <p>Their answer, of course, was no. If Trump had ordered them to do so, it would have been an unlawful order, and they would have refused. If he insisted, he would have risked imprisonment. If they had acted, so would they.</p>
   <p>Today, if a President orders the armed forces to shoot at protesters, it would still be an unlawful order. But Trump would enjoy absolute, unreviewable, immunity for giving it.</p>
   <p>It would still be unlawful for his subordinates to act upon the order. But Trump could promise to pardon subordinates who act. He could fire subordinates who refuse.</p>
   <p>Obviously, this would be, should be, illegitimate. A President is required by the Constitution to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" as much as he is empowered as Commander-in-Chief. But on Monday, the Supreme Court plainly and explicitly placed the latter before the former.</p>
   <p>Shooting a bunch of protesters "in the legs" is small potatoes. Anything the armed forces of the United States might conceivably do the President can order. Any legal restraints that might bind his subordinates, the President can pardon. Conscientious resistors can be fired, detained, made to go through some things.</p>
   <p>Even if the Federal government cannot, might not states prosecute generals and soldiers who injure, kidnap, or kill? The President's pardon power does not reach state law.</p>
   <p>This strikes me as a pretty thin read on which to place ones hopes. Good luck enforcing arrest warrants against members of the US military for following the President's orders. Good luck preventing the President from having the armed forces detain any prosecutors or judges determined to produce them.</p>
   <p>From Sonia Sotomayor's dissenting opinion:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Obviously, it is more essential now than it was a week ago that we not elect Donald Trump to a second term. But the identity of the President is not the problem here. Here's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling/">Joe Biden</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>You know, at the outset of our nation, it was the character of George Washington, our first president, that defined the presidency. He believed power was limited, not absolute, and that power would always reside with the people — always.</p>
    <p>Now, over 200 years later, with today’s Supreme Court decision, once again it will depend on the character of the men and women who hold that presidency that are going to define the limits of the power of the presidency, because the law will no longer do it.</p>
    <p>I know I will respect the limits of the presidential power, as I have for three and a half years. But any president, including Donald Trump, will now be free to ignore the law.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>It's not about Donald Trump. United States Presidents are usually not of great character. It takes tremendous ambition, and a certain degree of sociopathy, to win a prize as coveted and valuable as that office. Every President must be willing to do things that the less sociopathic among us would struggle to live with. Even just and necessary military action imposes misery and death on people who do not deserve it, who bear no fault.</p>
   <p>Donald Trump is bad. Barack Obama repudiated prohibitions against assassination that were table stakes for the "good guys" when I grew up, and simply <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2255.html">normalized the practice</a>. At least Obama was sufficiently chastened by risks of accountability that he had the Office of Legal Counsel <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/2014-06-23_barron-memorandum.pdf">perform a thorough analysis</a> before he assassinated US citizen. (They said it was okay.) Joe Biden has to his great credit <a href="https://theweek.com/foreign-policy/1007579/biden-nearly-ended-the-drone-war-and-nobody-noticed">largely ceased</a> America's drone assassination programs.</p>
   <p>Should we have trusted the character of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to protect our rights? The character of Bill Clinton? Richard Nixon? A rights regime that depends upon the character of the President is not a rights regime at all. Whether it's Donald Trump on anybody else, the ring of power that the Supreme Court has forged will do its work of tempting tyranny and atrocity. There are always crises, and in crises, anything seems justified. The scandal becomes failing to exploit the tools you have at hand.</p>
   <p>If the United States is to be a liberal democracy, this (legally <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-v-united-states-opinion-chief-roberts/678877/">shoddy</a>) decision must be reversed. Since the majority at the Supreme Court claims their coup is embedded in the Constitution itself, Congress is helpless to directly reverse it.</p>
   <p>John Roberts has always presented himself as an institutionalist. He is not an institutionalist. On Monday, John Roberts did far more damage to America's instituions than Donald Trump did on January 6.</p>
   <p>In the post <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> era — a decision we must now also revisit — only the Supreme Court can undo the work that it does when it speaks <em>ex cathedra</em> for the Constitution itself.</p>
   <p>I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7964.html">have been an advocate</a> for Supreme Court reform that strives not to be overtly political. I've sought procedures that would prevent factional misuse of the Court, rather than advance my own faction's views. Rather than expand or "pack" the Court, I have argued we should "merge the Court", to have its work be done by the full Federal apellate bench, with panels that hear individual cases chosen by lot. I still think that's a good approach.</p>
   <p>But this Court has created a crisis. The scandal becomes failing to exploit the tools you have at hand. It is to Joe Biden's deep discredit that, when pressed for Supreme Court reform, he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/pcscotus/">commissioned a study</a> and then did nothing with it.</p>
   <p>We are in a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/is-this-the-wile-e-coyote-moment/">Wile-E-Coyote moment</a>. The cliff has gone out from beneath our feet, but we have not yet fallen. The awful powers latent in the Supreme Court's decision have not yet been abused to crush democracy, but inevitably, inevitably, they will, if they remain as this Supreme Court has defined them.</p>
   <p>If the possibility is not permanently foreclosed on November 5, if by the grace of God alone we get another shot, we need to pack the court ASAP, and then generate a test case under which this calamity of a decision will be overturned. Normalizing court-packing is not great, but it's the only check the other branches currently have when the Supreme Court consitutionalizes atrocity.</p>
   <p>Once this awful decision has been relegated to history, I hope that we do restructure the Court to make it structurally less susceptible to serving as a tool for factional mischief. I hope that we do revisit — and temper rather than eliminate — <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>.</p>
   <p>But that is all for the future. The Supreme Court set the world aflame on Monday. If you haven't noticed the heat, if you don't notice it very soon, we are all going to burn.</p>

   <p>Perhaps Joe Biden is determined, for the best reasons or the worst, to be the Democratic Party's candidate for President, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/biden-election-debate-trump.html">despite</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/opinion/biden-trump-debate-danger.html">misgivings</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/biden-democrats-debate.html">engendered</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/joe-biden-tom-friedman.html">by</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/presidential-debate-trump-biden-2024.html">his</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/opinion/joe-biden-drop-out.html">recent</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/25/opinion/thepoint?smid=url-share#krugman-biden-must-withdraw">debate</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357876/biden-trump-debate-cnn-won-step-down-atlanta">performance</a>. If that is the case, Joe Biden will be the Democratic Party's candidate for President. He won the Democratic Party's primary election.</p>
   <p>Perhaps Joe Biden is not so determined to be the Democratic Party's candidate for President. If that is the case, you may never, ever know it.</p>
   <p>As old and stumbling as Joe Biden may have appeared on the debate stage, the Biden <em>Administration</em> has comported itself with tremendous intelligence. Should it entertain a change of leadership, let's imagine that it will do so with the same intelligence. What would that look like?</p>
   <p>First, over the next few weeks, expect any possibility of a change of leadership to be mocked, rejected, completely ruled out, in every public communication. This weekend's mini rebellion among pundits and Democratic Party has-beens will be crushed. Joe Biden may be too old, he may not be the candidate we'd want to save democracy itself, but he will be the only candidate we have.</p>
   <p>All of us who do not want a second Trump administration will fall back into line. He has, in fact, been the best domestic policy President since Lyndon Johnson. Compare him to the alternative, not the almighty, we will say. It is not the doddering old man we are electing, but the remarkable administration that has somehow conjured itself around him.</p>
   <p>It won't be an easy sell to politically detached swing voters, who <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">decide</a> US Presidential elections. A personal or symbolic connection to an imagined heroic leader may be more accessible to those voters than arcana like this adminstration's remarkable <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/lina-m-khan">FTC</a>, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/bidens-nlrb-restoring-rights/">NLRB</a>, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/10/getting-things-done/#deliverism">CFPB</a>, or its <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan">SAVE plan</a>. Nevertheless the excellence of the administration's accomplishments will have the benefit of being true, and it will be all we have.</p>
   <p>Why, if Biden is considering withdrawing, will his administration completely rule out the possibility of withdrawing? Because if there is continued, credible, will-he-won't-he chatter, that will weaken him and render his continued candidacy less tenable. And in order to successfully withdraw, he must withdraw from a position of strength rather than weakness within the Democratic Party firmament. Any succession must be a negotiated succession, and Joe Biden is his own <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/what-is-batna/">BATNA</a>.</p>
   <p>As the Biden Administration quietly discusses a potential replacement ticket, ambitious strivers will try to preen and threaten their way onto it. It must always be credible for the administration just to walk away and stick with Plan A. Disappointed shadow candidates may be tempted to appeal to the public, via their duly elected representatives on the opinion pages of <em>The New York Times</em>. The administration must make clear that its response to such perfidy would be to shut the whole thing down and double-down on Joe Biden's status as the default and inevitable Democratic nominee for President.</p>
   <p>The stupidest idea widely mooted is for an "open convention". Obviously, pundits love the idea. We can have a dramatic, fast-paced horserace to supplant this current one, which smells like mothballs and stale poop. But just because a game show is good television does not mean it is a good way to choose a nominee.</p>
   <p>An "open convention" would have no meaningful democratic legitimacy. No one actually voted for the delegates who will appear at the Democratic Party convention. Democrats voted for whoever was pledged to Joe Biden. Which particular humans show up on the convention floor is determined by processes that are not meaningfully democratic. Those processes may seem "random", but they are not, they have all kinds of systematic biases towards certain kinds of enthusiasts and operatives not remotely representative of Democratic Party rank-and-file. Choice by convention delegates is not some defensible sort of <a href="https://equalitybylot.com/introduction-to-sortition-government-by-jury/">sortition</a> by the back door.</p>
   <p>The only person with any democratic mandate to choose a successor to Joe Biden as Democratic Party nominee is Joe Biden himself, who won a Democratic Party primary open to the public at-large.</p>
   <p>Putting aside endlessly contestable arguments about legitimacy, the whole point of switching horses is risk management. The only reason Joe Biden would and should step down is if he is sure his replacement would have a much stronger shot of winning the general election. Throwing the dice on an unpredictable disorganized contest, one that might become bitterly divisive and even inspire rioting or violence at a Chicago Democratic Party convention, does not meet that bar.</p>
   <p>By the time of the convention, the identity of the Democratic nominee will be a <em>fait accompli</em>. Not-really-elected delegates will not decide, and should not decide. There are two supedelegates. They will decide.</p>
   <p>The first superdelegate, of course, is Joe Biden himself. The second superdelegate is Kamala Harris. No change of ticket can occur without Harris' enthusiastic endorsement.</p>
   <p>One way to win her endorsement is to put Harris at the head of the ticket. That might be a reasonable option! But observers underestimate Harris by presuming that she herself — me! me! me! — is the only alternative candidate that she would endorse. Harris ran in a Presidential primary, and withdrew quickly when she realized the electoral stars would not align for her.</p>
   <p>The Biden-<i>Harris</i> Administration will study the politics of potential tickets as best it can. There may be some degree of bias, some tendency to overestimate the strengths and underestimate the deficiencies of a Harris-led ticket. But <em>some</em> degree of bias will be a limited degree of bias. If the Biden-Harris Administration comes internally to a conclusion that a different candidate would have a much stronger shot, Harris is not such an egotist that she will risk throwing the country to Donald Trump in exchange for a lottery ticket to become President. Of course, Harris will negotiate a cabinet position for herself, or a quiet promise of favorable consideration should a vacancy arise on the Supreme Court. But she will not stand implacably in the way of whomever the administration determines to be the strongest contender.</p>
   <p>The most likely outcome of all of this is just what it was before the miserable debate. Most likely, the general election will be a contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Biden might be implacably opposed to stepping down. Or, he may be open to the idea, but this delicate, Democratic-Party-internal dance to annoint a credible successor might break down. Some narcissist the administration decides against could take his case to the opinion pages. If there's too much of that, the administration will fall back to the inevitable and deny it ever seriously considered making a change.</p>
   <p>But if ambitious Democrats prove willing to abide a discreet selection process, it is quite possible that the only two people who can choose their successor will do so.</p>
   <p>Paradoxically, the more inevitable a Biden-Harris ticket comes to seem over the next few weeks, the more possible the emergence of an alternative becomes. But in no case is it very likely.</p>

   <p>Since I <a href="2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">tussled</a> — gently I hope! — with <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/">Ned Resnikoff</a>, who is Policy Director of California YIMBY, I want to give credit where it is due.</p>
   <p>California YIMBY <a href="https://cayimby.org/news-events/statement-in-support-of-the-east-solano-plan/">recently came out in favor</a> of the "East Solano Plan", which is bureaucratese for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-forever-promises-new-solano-county-investments/"><em>California Forever</em></a>.</p>
   <p>As I said <a href="2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">before</a>, I favor that project, and wish it every success.</p>
   <p>I am delighted to see CA YIMBY back dense, greenfield development at scale. I think it is the only approach that can match the enormity of our housing problem, a catastrophe that renders life insecure and dystopian for nearly all of us not sitting on equity from a home bought years ago.</p>
   <p>I think ultimately it will <a href="2024/06/07/only-the-state-can-house-us/index.html">take an activist state</a> to jumpstart and "derisk" this project of building new, dense places, in order for it to happen at sufficient scale, and in a diversity of places, not within just superstar metros. Resnikoff <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/p/yimbys-proving-fatalists-wrong">disagrees</a>. Regardless of who is right or wrong in that debate, I am delighted that we share an enthusiasm for dense habitations built on "greenfields", rather than just "infill" development of already inhabited places.</p>
   <p>I know that it is <a href="https://x.com/cafedujord/status/1803290168331489303">difficult</a> <a href="https://x.com/bhargreaves/status/1803491835530133756">for</a> <a href="https://x.com/mnolangray/status/1803322692256584048">California YIMBY</a> to take this position, because most YIMBY activism has been devoted to reforming land-use regulation in support of infill development. Many YIMBYs consider greenfield development inherently "sprawl", an enemy to good, green urbanism.</p>
   <p>I think California YIMBY is right. Dense development is green development, almost wherever it is. It's the density that matters, not the where.</p>
   <p>There are roughly 340 million people in the United States. All of them need to be housed. The "footprint" of that housing, in terms of simple land area, land that can be neither wilderness nor farmland, is solely a function of average density. At suburban densities — call it 2000 humans per square mile — we require 170,000 square miles for our habitat. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density&amp;oldid=1229928813">Paris density</a>, the same 340M people could be accommodated on less than 7000 square miles.</p>
   <p>Density is overwhelmingly the factor that divides green from less-green development. Besides raw land area used, people live more efficiently and ecologically when they live densely. In a suburb you drive to your errands. In a dense city you walk or take transit. There are economies of scale in distribution and infrastructure, especially if you can plan in advance rather than suffering the economic and human costs of retrofitting.</p>
   <p>An exception is when residents would have to commute long distances. But more and more work can be done remotely, or distributed to local offices. People don't like to commute! New residents of new cities will sort themselves, and be disproportionately people who can work in or near their new homes, rather than schlep to some distant city center. Of course it would be great if we built trains to make any schlepping ecological and convenient! But we shouldn't hold our new-city-ing hostage to that. One thing at a time is how anything actually happens.</p>
   <p>Yes, it is great, when we can, to build densely near existing centers of on-site employment. All else equal, such housing that can serve a greater variety of people at lower environmental cost. But wherever we build, if we build densely and at sufficient scale to amortize the cost of urban amenities, we will dramatically reduce both our geographical footprint and the environmental weight of our lifestyles.</p>
   <p>Dense living does not imply cramped living. If we build at midrise or higher, we can accommodate Barcelona to Manhattan densities with generously sized apartments. The elevator is an underrated form of transit.</p>
   <p>Human beings are clever, and people <a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/the-5-coolest-trends-in-urbanism">have gotten very good</a>, especially in Europe and Asia, at planning and building dense, extremely desirable places to live.</p>
   <p>That's the prize.</p>
   <p>We can do it too! And we don't have to confine the work to the geographies where it is hardest to do, to places already inhabited at moderate densities whose residents understandably get grumpy when we come in with our bright eyes to reconfigure their worlds.</p>
   <p>California YIMBY is doing the right thing on the East Solana Plan. However we organize and finance it all, the way we address America's housing <em>and</em> ecological problems at their actual scale is building new dense communities in places now only lightly inhabited.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>One of the drivers of authoritarianism is a sense we just can't get anything done, that solving our multiplying polycrises demands a strongman who can break through the gridlock, get everybody moving in the same direction, actually do stuff.</p>
   <p>It's easy to be antiauthoritarian because you think the wannabe authoritarians are fascists, white supremicists, Christian nationalists, assholes. That's largely true!</p>
   <p>But if your pro-democracy activism is centered around opposing these easy evils, you are countering the weakest rather than the strongest arguments of your opponents. You might or might not win the narrow political squeakers that our electoral system now sets up, but you won't persuade the bulk of the public to any new consensus. And without a new consensus, well, eventually one of these most important elections of our lifetime will be lost, and perhaps that will be that.</p>
   <p>It is in fact correct and true that solving our muliplying polycrises demands a state capable of overcoming narrow vetoes and forging some broad consensus that can break through the gridlock, get most of us moving in the same direction, actually do stuff.</p>
   <p>If you believe in electoral democracy as a <em>practical</em> rather than merely desirable system of government, then you must believe that it is possible for a democratic state to recruit sufficient alignment to meet the challenges that the polity faces.</p>
   <p>If you think that's going to happen by "our side" definitively winning and simply banishing the other side to perpetual marginality, well, that is also what we think that they will do to us. So long as that's the plan, each side will think of themselves as the anti-authoritarian side. Nothing will change, or, even worse, something will.</p>
   <p>If we want <em>genuinely democratic</em> state capacity, state capacity that does not rely on disenfranchising much of the country, we have to address the institutional factors that favor polarization rather than consensus.</p>
   <p>We have to <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7828.html">move past a narrow majoritarianism</a> — which is a much weaker basis for democratic legitimacy than proponents on "our side" often pretend — towards a system in which most of the public feels on-board, rather than either winning or shut out.</p>
   <p>If Democrats are really pro-democracy, they have to do more than argue only reelecting them can save democracy. They must bequeath to the public a system in which citizens actually have meaningful choices, rather than cling to and capitalize on an <em>it's-us-or-Adolf</em> dynamic. Are Democrats pro-democracy, or just pro conditions that help them win their next election?</p>
   <p>The reforms I favor Congress could pass in a day. Elections for single-winner, at-large positions like Senator and President should be by <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">approval voting</a>, which favors candidates everyone can live with over candidates that members of conflictual factions most ardently support, and which encourages the emergence of multiple parties. Elections to the House of Representative should be by some form of proportional representation, whether it's my unlikely dorky favorite (<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7043.html">random ballot</a>), a conventional party-list based system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single-transferable-vote</a>, or the clever hybrid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">MMP</a>.</p>
   <p>Perhaps you have different reforms in mind. This is a democracy! But you are not objectively pro-democracy if you are not working to reform a system that, by virtue of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">widely understood social dynamics</a>, will predictably, recurringly, almost inevitably, yield polarization, gridlock, and incapacity.</p>
   <p>States are the <em>sine qua non</em> of human capability. A certain kind of libertarian might resent this, but it's obviously true. Human achievement and flourishing stratify across borders, favoring states that act and act well over states incapable of acting or that act poorly.</p>
   <p>In a different era, when communication technology had not so completely tamed geography, the deficiencies of the US political system were <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">kept in check</a> by the diversity of an all-politics-is-local world.</p>
   <p>Now all politics is national. Dysfunction latent in our arrangements has emerged, a blister burst, a festival of maggots dancing in the wound. We're not going to uninvent the internet. Our national state will yield little but polarization, gridlock, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pay_auction">all-pay auctions</a> in favor of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7759.html">political consultants</a>, until we change the institutions that structure it.</p>
   <p>We <a href="2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">need state capacity</a> now more than ever. We can do better than succumb to authoritarianism or <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/bourne/1918/war-is-the-health-of-the-state.html">gin up some war</a> to find it.</p>
   <p>But we <em>will</em> do one of those things if we don't do anything else to restore a capable state.</p>
   <p>Electoral reform is possible. It is easy. Nothing is more urgent, or more hopeful.</p>

   <p>Ned Resnikoff offers a <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/p/yimbys-proving-fatalists-wrong">great rejoinder</a> to my <a href="2024/06/07/only-the-state-can-house-us/index.html">recent piece</a>, <em>Only the state can house us</em>. Go read it if you haven't!</p>
   <p>Lots of places in that piece, I felt like Resnikoff didn't have an accurate understanding of my position. That's my fault, not his. I thought I'd try to clarify.</p>
   <p>First a narrow thing. Resnikoff writes</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>What’s instead needed — in fact, what he describes as “an inevitability” — is a massive social housing program that will create millions of government-owned, government-subsidized housing units across the country.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>That isn't quite right. I don't propose some giant unified "social program", and I don't propose that housing units should necessarily remain government-owned.</p>
   <p>I propose — and yes, I do think quite inevitable — a much more <em>dirigiste</em> approach to housing. The state would subsidize development of new communities in places and under terms private business otherwise would not invest. Call it a CHIPS Act for new cities.</p>
   <p>I hope we would experiment with a variety of models, from the Singapore model — basically sales of publicly developed homes to residents — to "<a href="https://citymonitor.ai/environment/housing/red-vienna-how-austrias-capital-earned-its-place-in-housing-history">Red Vienna</a>"-style rentals from a municipal corporation. But I believe we need new cities built in greenfields, not just liberalized infill of already desirable places, in order to meet the housing challenges that we currently face, and the much more difficult challenges that await us. I think we will require an interventionist state.</p>
   <p>If you want more specifics on the kind of development I'd propose, please see <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8772.html"><em>Microcities</em></a>.</p>
   <p>Resnikoff does not comment on the reason I give <em>why</em> state-led housing production is inevitable. We are already in a miserable housing affordability crisis. I argue that forseeable climate events are likely to provoke migrations and shortages at a different scale than moving-to-amenity price-bidding has thus far.</p>
   <p>I wonder, does Resnikoff agree or disagree that this is at least a plausible scenario? If it happens, our housing problem is going to feel less like today's growth ill-accommodated, and more like wartime logistics. <em>That's</em> why state action is inevitable. We can either develop capabilities within the state to superintend construction of high-quality, dense, mixed-use communities, or we can fail to do so, and then build slapdash, utilitarian, barrack communities that will remain people's homes for years if not lifetimes.</p>
   <p>I think it's urgent that we develop state capacity to endow high quality new communities quickly and at scale, <em>now</em>, so that we know it as a practical thing when the crisis comes and overwhelms us. The alternative will become a terrible scar to our body politic, slums for millions of people. And if we are going to start building new communities now, to develop this state capacity, why not make it an alternative to the NIMBY-YIMBY trench wars?</p>
   <p>In general, I think Resnikoff read my piece as more of a broadside against YIMBY than I intended. I'd characterize myself as YIMBY-skeptical or YIMBY-critical. But that's not the same as anti-YIMBY (or NIMBY, or PHIMBY, or whatever).</p>
   <p>People who share a lot of values often disagree more bitterly than people who are more straightforward adversaries. Betrayal is a crueler cut than enmity.</p>
   <p>I share a lot of values with YIMBYs!</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>I agree with YIMBYs that housing scarcity in desirable places to live is the signal domestic crisis of our time. We can't fix anything if we don't restore housing abundance in safe, lively, places with good schools that offer residents a high quality of life.</p></li>
    <li>
     <p>For a lot of reasons, I agree with YIMBY visions of urbanism. Exurban McMansions may offer some residents a high quality of life, but in ways that cannot possibly scale and are necessarily exclusive. Dense mixed-use development is what does scale, is (contra some green intuitions) the way to house large numbers of humans with a light environmental footprint and also with the greatest joy, if it is done well. In a good future, the majority of humans live at near-Manhattan densities, and car travel is for trips, not for everyday life. That's best for human flourishing, and best for the planet.</p>
     <p>"Done well" is an important caveat! Density is a magnifying glass, both for social virtue and for social vice. Bad density is very bad. But excellent, delightful, dense development is a tractible sociotechnical problem. They build out <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2024/03/05/seestadt-aspern-housing-berger-parkkinen-vienna-social-housing-revival/">little</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-25/nordhavn-in-copenhagen-is-the-future-of-sustainable-urban-planning">utopias</a> in Europe all the time.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>I disagree with YIMBYs about some important things too.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>As a matter of tactics, I think that focusing on infill rather than greenfield densification is a big mistake. For all the reasons described <a href="2024/06/07/only-the-state-can-house-us/index.html">in my prior piece</a> — what Resnikoff <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/p/yimbys-proving-fatalists-wrong">characterizes</a> as "futility theses" — I don't think that infill densification in already desirable places will come anywhere close to matching the scale of the problem.</p></li>
    <li>
     <p>As a matter of ethics, even though I agree with YIMBY ends, I have problems with their means. I think they often understate and deny the costs of the changes they propose to incumbent residents. I think the people they often mock as NIMBYs have understandable reasons for the positions they take, motivations that merit social and political respect. Left YIMBYs sometimes suggest that what they propose is a kind of redistribution. (Matt Yglesias once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222055850/https://tinyletter.com/mattyglesias/letters/what-s-driving-me-is-driving-you">described</a> the YIMBY project as "as 'radical land reform' in the sense of the Latin American left.") I'm for a lot of redistribution, but I think we all can understand that when redistributing, questions about from whom, to whom, how it is proposed to be done, how it will actually work out in practice, are really important.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>These two critiques are mutually reinforcing. One reason I think infill densification in already desirable places is tactically challenging is because achieving it often involves threatening perhaps the most intimate and powerful circumstance of peoples' lives, their homes and neighborhoods. Some people are filthy rich and who cares if they don't like the new development they can move. But most Americans struggle to afford housing in safe, desirable, lively places. When they have done so, when they have achieved that dream, it becomes the anchor of, and usually the crowning economic achievement of, their lives. Many households have devoted years of energy and volunteerism to maintaining and improving neighborhoods the market now finds so desirable.</p>
   <p>In poorer commuinities, the rentals might not be a crowning economic achievement, but most of people's "wealth" takes the form of easily disruptible, informal social capital. Wealthier reformers don't even perceive this, because they are accustomed to meeting their needs primarily through the market and perhaps insurance from immediate family. But busting up a neighborhood, with all its informal connections and friendships, its habits of help, people who owe and are owed one, is, as a wise man once said, a big fucking deal. This sort of displacement can be a terrible redistribution away from the already poor.</p>
   <p>For all of these reasons — <em>futility</em>, I know! — residents of existing neighborhoods, of every social class, have very powerful reasons to seek to exercise control over whether and how their neighborhoods change. Tactically, fighting against that seems like it should be a last rather than first resort, if you mean to achieve housing abundance soon. Ethically, even if — <em>fuck futility!</em> — you are able to organize over the heads of, outside the boundaries of, affected neighborhoods and impose "wins" from above, well, that's good for housing abundance. But it may or may not be a net good thing. It depends.</p>
   <p>I have never understood, at some deep basal level, why a reformer would choose to go for housing abundance <em>in this way</em>. It seems to me, historically, when metropolitan areas have grown in population quickly, the unit at which change has occurred is <em>neighborhood</em> or <em>new town</em>, rather than project-by-project infill in stably settled places.</p>
   <p>My hypothesis is that we got this approach, and have kept doubling down on it, because a generation of young professionals really wanted to move to particular, already settled, places. They disliked that they either were priced out, or — to their credit! — they were not, but disliked that they were pricing out incumbent residents.</p>
   <p>It is understandable that actual people coming of age want to move to particular existing places. It does an individual little good to imagine that someday there might be other wonderful choices. But once we shift our perspective from wanderer to reformer, an imagination of what could be, of alternatives we are capable of achieving that are just a bit less adjacent to the <em>status quo</em>, strikes me as essential.</p>
   <p>Anyway, I am not "anti-YIMBY". I lived in San Francisco for eight and a half years. On controversies surrounding particular projects, I usually favored the YIMBY side. I couldn't help but notice, however, and it did upset me that almost always the fights over some ridiculous abuse of historical preservation were in the gentrifying Mission, rather than, say, in upzone-the-affluent Pacific Heights. I was very excited by <a href="https://sfocii.org/projects/hunters-point-shipyard/overview">Hunter's Point</a>, a greenfield which I hope will be developed well, because it was going to dispossess or displace no one. I was very happy to see new construction in my own Richmond district. I wish I could afford to live in it.</p>
   <p>We left San Francisco in large part because we were priced out of housing. We had a rent-stabilized apartment, thank God, but the kid was growing. Four-hundred-and-some square feet wasn't cutting it. I had to save my marriage. Now I drive infinite miles for every stupid errand in Pinellas County, Florida, rather than just strolling down Clement Street.</p>
   <p>We'd move back to SF in a second if the twelve hundred square feet we have here were more affordable. If there were a plausible, ethical way to make that happen over a relevant time horizon, I would be all for it. I think there is not, though. I think the plausible ways aren't ethical, and the ethical ways aren't plausible.</p>
   <p>Well, that's not quite right. There are the approaches YIMBYs historically haven't emphasized. If, as Resnikoff suggests, I am out-of-date on actually existing YIMBY-ism, and YIMBYs now devote part of their considerable talents to promoting dense new development on greenfields beyond the borders of existing cities, then I am very happy to stand corrected. The plausible way to create housing abundance rapidly is through new neighborhoods and new towns. The San Francisco Bay Area is full of undeveloped land.</p>
   <p>I don't love some of the backers of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-forever-promises-new-solano-county-investments/"><em>California Forever</em></a>, and I fear their stealth buyout approach to addressing holdout problems may have doomed the project. But I wish them every success. I hope the project ushers in a new age of new-town development, one pursued in a manner less adversarial to publics constituted through our imperfectly democratic state, including at the local level. Eminent domain does exist, even if the backers of this project are ideologically opposed. Some of the people involved in <em>California Forever</em> are people I knew in San Francisco as prominent YIMBYs. At that time they seemed skeptical of new-town development, fearing that in a US context it would necessarily degnerate to single-family suburbs, endless sprawl. I am very glad their views have changed and I support their current work. (Manhattanize Mare Island!)</p>
   <p>There are lots of old-school YIMBY initiatives that pass my cost-benefit test, that I support, but that I think can only help on the margin. I support "by right" construction of ADUs and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/wa-senate-passes-bill-allowing-duplexes-fourplexes-in-single-family-zones/">missing middle</a> housing, for example. Obviously it's a judgment call. I respect the residents who adamantly disagree. I have deeply mixed feelings about organizing over their heads. But my judgment is that given the low density of single-family neighborhoods and the small scale of the construction legalized, this sort of development represents a pretty limited threat to the character of those neighborhoods and the lives of the people who live there.</p>
   <p>So I support these reforms. But I still feel icky substituting my judgment about how big an imposition these laws are for residents' own. I think local government is a critical component of democracy, and would <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8654.html">prefer approaches</a> that persuade local governments by first persuading their constituents, rather than coerce local governments over the opposition of incumbent residents.</p>
   <p>In any case, I don't believe these approaches can achieve the scale or densification that our housing and environmental crises demand. Will these mostly car-served neighborhoods become garlanded by walkable amenities and public transit, once ADUs and triplexes emerge? We can hope so. Maybe my quantitative intuitions are off, my imagination too limited. But while it's <em>per se</em> good that more people will get to live in the places they'd like to live, it's <em>per se</em> bad to overrule existing residents. I have a hard time seeing these reforms impacting supply enough to dent the cost crisis, so long as so many people seek to live in a relatively small number of extraordinarily places.</p>
   <p>As I emphasized in my prior piece, I think the heart of the problem is geographic inequality. As long as so few places — the "superstar cities", a few "<a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/book/coming-apart-the-state-of-white-america-1960-2010/">super zips</a>" in other metros — are where the amenities and opportinties and safety and good schools are, we will have a whole country trying to pile into them. You really would have to Manhattanize to have any hope of accommodating that sort of demand, and that really would overthrow the character of people's neighborhoods.</p>
   <p>Resnikoff is right to point out that the YIMBY movement has gone from success to success, that it's achieved on its path more than I ever expected it would. Maybe you should just write off my judgment? Why are you even reading this?</p>
   <p>But if you are still here, I'll say again, even with YIMBYs' surprising achievements, land-use liberalization continues to strike me as an approach incapable of meeting the scale of the problem.</p>
   <p>Politicians often boast about reforms using past reforms as their baseline. Dodd-Frank, Obama reminded us, represented the toughest regulation of the financial system since the New Deal. That was true! It still left a predatory, broken, corrupt financial system in place, and our pathway toward neofeudalism undisturbed. Solutions don't need to meet the scale of low expectations from past nonsolutions. They need to meet the scale of the actual problem. YIMBY organizing has succeeded much more than history suggested or fatalists like me imagined that it would. Yet the question remains, while demand remains heavily concentrated in a few places, can supply ever match its fluctuations, even under very liberal land-use regimes, without development of new greenfields in active collaboration with the state?</p>
   <p>I don't know. Neither do you, dear reader. You know my guess. What's yours? Here's <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1540-6229.12490">the Orlando, Redfearn study I cited</a> in the previous piece, whose conclusions match my priors. Enthusiastic YIMBYs have their studies too.</p>
   <p>Here's a graph. It's rent inflation in three metros, adjusted for overall inflation. The graph will mechanically underestimate fluctuations, up and down, because the numerator is a component of the denominator. It's laggy: New rent prices fluctuate more quickly than the average rents in the CPI basket. It's quick and dirty. I've normalized everything to 100 on January 1, 2010.</p><img src="2024/06/13/yimboree/CPI-rent-over-CPI-SEA-SFO-TPA.png" width="100%">
   <p>It is very easy to explain this graph in terms of demand. The 2010s were a tech-led decade, so San Francisco and Seattle both rocket. Seattle <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/housing-tech-hub-building-17339487.php">permitted a lot more housing</a> over the period, more than three times as much in popuation-adjusted terms. (They are cities of similar size.) Their inflation-adjusted rental prices nevertheless grow in lockstep from 2012 to 2020. Seattle's price growth slightly exceeded San Francisco's, despite its much more vigorous construction. Post-pandemic, prices decline and stay declined in construction-lagging San Francisco, but, after a dip, bounce back to their highs in Seattle.</p>
   <p>Throughout the 2010s, both tech-powerhouse cities faced strong housing demand, whose price inelasticity meant Seattle's incremental new supply barely registered. Post-pandemic, tech opportunities have softened a bit in both markets, but San Francisco has been plagued in the national conversation by a persistent "drug-addled shithole" narrative while Seattle has not.</p>
   <p>It's easy to explain these price curve from a demand perspective. From a supply perspective... not so much. Prices rose faster, and have stayed higher, in the city that permitted much more.</p>
   <p>I've also graphed my current home, the Tampa metro. Tampa's permitting rate, per population, has been <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1oXMT">comparable to Seattle or Houston</a>, but post-pandemic demand (to which my own family contributed) has made it the rent-price-growth leader of <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1oWe8">all the metros I have looked at</a>. (Fuck me.) Miami has permitted less and seen less price growth than Tampa.</p>
   <p>Permitting is not a great proxy for YIMBY land-use policy, because it is a function of demand as well as regulation. For San Francisco vs Seattle, I think we can agree that both cities faced relentlessly high-demand over the 2010s, so they're a good match for a supply-side policy comparison. If you tell me the Miami, Tampa comparison is no good because lower starting prices drew population to Tampa, which is what drew the permitting rather than any difference in land use regulation, I'll shrug and say yeah, that might be right. Nevertheless, there's always a demand story in these price graphs. You sure have to squint to tell supply stories.</p>
   <p>A counterexample might be Austin, which <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1oXMT">by the permitting numbers</a> looks like YIMBY paradise, and which is currently <a href="https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2024/02/austin-apartments-boomed-and-rents-went-down-now-some-builders-are-dismantling-the-cranes/">enjoying a delightful rent price slump</a>. Austin's rent component of CPI seems not to be available on FRED, so I can't include it in my lazy little experiment.</p>
   <p>But I think the YIMBY story is probably a big part of what's going on in Austin. My view, which is the view beautifully documented in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1540-6229.12490">the Orlando, Redfearn paper</a>, is that while metros are small, supply very often can keep up, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6487.html">because there are greenfields near demand drivers still to be developed</a>. Once greenfields are exhausted — because the city is confined to a penninsula, or because it has sprawled so far that new exurbs would be far from drivers of demand, or because regulation prevents further sprawl — then cities cannot keep up. When demand is high, prices will spike, but greenfield expansion really can help. Infill is by its nature an order of magnitude harder and slower and more expensive.</p>
   <p>YIMBYs in my experience have diverse views about "sprawl". I think the correct position is that</p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>greenfield development should be encouraged, not restricted; and</p></li>
    <li>
     <p>the political challenge is to ensure that edge-city growth takes the form of dense, mixed-use development, rather than single-family-home cul-de-sacs.</p></li>
   </ol>
   <p>Even when supply growth can't make a dent in price, it doesn't follow that barricading supply is good policy. All that extra housing in Seattle translates to a lot more people who get to live there, people who choose living there even at high Seattle prices. That's a real benefit. But if the housing was permitted over strenuous objections of nearby residents, that betrays real costs too. Those costs and benefits are hard to quantify. My intuitions mostly side with the YIMBYs, that the benefits probably exceeded the costs. But I could be wrong, and I don't see a way out our housing catastrophe in that kind of delicate balance.</p>
   <p>I think the work we have to do is to guide demand into places we can supply at scale.</p>
   <p>Resnikoff writes</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>But the other reason is that we won’t be able to demand manage our way out of population growth in superstar cities. We already tried that in the second half of the twentieth century when we downzoned San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York to cap population growth. How did that work out?</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Despite our miscommunications, I think Resnikoff understands that merely capping supply in places with lots of demand is not a form of "demand management" I would propose or support.</p>
   <p>But we have never tried to manage demand by using state power intentionally, to endow attractive new communities, and then to subsidize amenities, opportunities, and relationships under which agglomeration effects will likely take hold, bootstrapping "natural" demand.</p>
   <p>Does Resnikoff think this impossible? Does he have a "futility thesis" of his own?</p>
