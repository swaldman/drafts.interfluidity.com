   <p>My friend Chris Peel recently did <a href="https://github.com/chrisvwx/taxFoo.jl">a deep dive into US Federal income tax schedules</a>. He computed effective tax rates by inflation-adjusted income for years 1862 to 2024, taking into account the standard deduction. I thought it'd be fun to visualize his results, and it's proven to be an interesting exercise.</p>
   <p>First, here's the full history of effective US tax rates as a single surface.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-surface-with-std-deduction-front-south-east.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-surface-with-std-deduction-front-south-east.png" alt="Surface graph of US effective tax rates, 1862-2024"></a></p>

   <p>Our data is rates for married households, filing jointly. The numbers are computed from ordinary income rates only, so they will be overstated for high-income households, who enjoy a great deal of tax-advantaged capital income. All dollar amounts are CPI-adjusted 2024 dollars.</p>
   <hr>
   <p>What stood out immediately to me in this graph is the constancy at the middle. Since the World War II peak, rates have collapsed at the high end and at the low end. At middle incomes? Not so much.</p>
   <p>Let's take a look at the same information as cross-sections by income.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1862-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1862-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1862-2024"></a></p>
   <p>Now let's zoom into the post-war period. We'll begin in 1945, when the US had its highest income tax rates, from which they have subsequently collapsed.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1945-2024"></a></p>
   <p>I think it's helpful to divide this picture into four categories:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Ultra high income: income ($10M, $100M)</li>
    <li>High income: ($500K, $1M)</li>
    <li>Middle income: ($63K, $100K, $200K)</li>
    <li>Low income: $10K</li>
   </ul>
   <p>(As of 2022, the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S1903">median income for married couples</a> was about $109,000. Assuming, conservatively, it has remained constant in inflation-adjusted terms, that would be $115,000 dollars today. Real median income has grown over time, and we'll want to encompass a bit above the median, so we let the range from $63K to $200K 2024 dollars represent our "middle".)</p>
   <p>The first lesson here is that <em>income tax policy has been least important for the middle-income group</em>. There's just a lot less variation at $63K, $100K, and $200K levels than at levels above and below.</p>

    <p><em>Data restricted to the period 1945 - 2024. Rates and ranges are rounded to whole numbers. Apparent miscalculation of the range at 500K is a rounding artifact.</em></p>
   </div> A second lesson, which was entirely new to me until Chris pointed it out, is that for low-income people, the crucial tax reform happened in 1970, under Richard Nixon! 
   <p><a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/file/182549/download?token=IeifAYsd">From 1944-1969</a> the standard deduction was defined as 10% of income to a maximum of $1000. That meant that, then and now, the standard deduction did very little for high-income earners. But before 1970, it also did very little for low-income earners. In 1970, the standard deduction became defined as a fixed amount, which meant that people with very low incomes could deduct everything. A fixed-amount standard deduction renders the effective income tax very progressive at low incomes, but its influence fades as incomes rise.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1962-1972.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1962-1972.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1962-1972"></a></p>
   <p>A third lesson is just how terrible JFK's tax cuts were, for those of us who believe that democracy and a decent society depend upon preventing plutocratic wealth accumulation. Between 1963 and 1965, effective tax rates paid by $100M earners dropped by 20 percentage point, while a middle-income earner making $100K (in 2024 dollars) saw relief of 4 to 5 percentage points.</p>
   <p>A fourth lesson is that the period 1965 to 1980 was a political economy catastrophe. There were no tax increases on ultra-high-income earners during the period, but ordinary high-income earners saw their tax burden steadily rise.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1965-1980.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1965-1980.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1965-1980"></a></p>
   <p>Ordinary high-income earners represent a very important group of people. They are most successful professionals, influential in society and much more numerous than ultra-high-income earners. This is the group that actually peoples the commanding heights of the economy and the media. Raising taxes on this group while holding plutocratic earners harmless was a terrible own goal. It delivered very little of the main benefit of progressive taxation (preventing plutocratic wealth accumulation!) while it sewed the seeds for a tax revolution.</p>
   <p>The tax policy of this period was not calibrated to win the hearts and minds of middle-income earners. Lower-middle-income earners did enjoy some tax relief, but upper-middle-income earners endured increases, the middle-middle was basically flat. I suspect the dumb policy was motivated fiscal revenue accounting. Increasing rates on high-income earners delivers revenue, while ultra-high-income earners avoided their much higher taxes by not realizing personal income.</p>
   <p>But financing the government is not about revenue in accounting terms. It depends on the disinflationary impulse that taxation provokes. Taxing high earners is less disinflationary, serves to finance spending less effectively, than taxing people lower in the income scale. Because affluent people's marginal dollar of income is usually saved rather than spent, taxing it does not reduce spending. So the additional revenue was largely fruitless. The additional resentment, however, made fertile ground from which a terrible flower would soon blossom.</p>
   <p><a href="https://x.com/interfluidity/status/1092519956439130112">Billionaire politics</a> is about making human shields of the merely affluent.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-1988.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-1988.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1980-1988"></a></p>
   <p>A fifth lesson is that Ronald Reagan's tax policy was horrendous, and is largely still with us today.</p>
   <p>Those high-income earners who had grown resentful of their tax burden, which had been steadily increasing since the mid-sixties? They finally got their, um, retribution. Ultra-high-income earners, who had suffered no increase at all, hitched a ride on this tax revolution by affluent professionals and won the biggest rate cuts of all.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile lower-middle-income earners saw their rates <em>rise</em> over the period. What the fuck was the matter with Kansas?</p>
   <p>George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton undid only about a quarter of the damage Reagan had done. Not to mention JFK.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-2000.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-2000.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1980-2000"></a></p>
   <p>And that is the world in which we continue to live. Post Y2K, rates fluctuate, but rates on ultra-high-income earners have basically been flat.</p>
   <p>Middle income rates rarely move much. But grading on a curve, cosidering the narrow range over which middle income rates do fluctuate, the tax cuts under George W. Bush and Trump did yield middle income tax relief. This relief has stuck, as only high and ulta-high income rates reverted under Obama, and nothing much has changed over Biden.</p>
   <p>While I'm sure it's true, in dollar terms, that the overwhelming majority of the 2017 tax cuts go to very high earners, Trump, unlike Ronald Reagan, did actually deliver at least a little to people at middle incomes.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-2000-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-2000-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 2000-2024"></a></p>
   <p>(Low income effective rates have been flat at zero throught the period. If you are wondering where the $10K line is, it's hidden by the X-axis.)</p>
   <p>Pulling back, the overarching story is simple:</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1945-2024"></a></p>
   <p>Since World War II, US Federal income tax rates have fallen at every level. At middle incomes, they've deflated only modestly. But under the Kennedy and Reagan administrations, rates on ultra-high-income earners were demolished, in acts of social vandalism that have never been undone.</p>
   <p>By throwing just a few small chicken bones to the middle class and higher-income professionals, mad occultists opened a portal to resurgent plutocracy. You can feel its dark wings thumping. We are <a href="https://x.com/">living</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">with</a> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/barre-seid-heartland-institute-hillsdale-college-gmu">the</a> <a href="https://secure.winred.com/trump-national-committee-jfc/lp-ads-guilty-verdict-google/">consequences</a>.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it's time we reseal the portal.</p>

   <p>David Austin Walsh <a href="https://x.com/Gurdur/status/1794781436471640276">expressed frustration</a> with how difficult he has found landing a tenure-track position as an academic historian. He implied being "white dude" was one source of disadvantage in his search.</p>
   <p>That is a sensitive claim. The requisite, almost <em>pro forma</em>, scandal ensued. Walsh offered <a href="https://x.com/DavidAstinWalsh/status/1795029033777787327">an apology</a>, emphasizing perceptively the real source of his problem. Good positions in academia have been made scarce, cannibalized by the temporary and contingent roles into which Walsh himself has been slotted. In a game of musical chairs, it is an analytical error to blame any advantage of other players (real, perceived, or misperceived) for the difficulty of finding a seat. The recriminations just amuse the people who take away the chairs.</p>
   <p>There is a kind of irony in scabs lamenting the decline of good union jobs, except that academics have flattered themselves to be something above and apart from mere labor. Academics are society's true meritocrats, each one a self-made hero. The neoliberalization of the academy was sealed when faculty reconceived themselves as market victors rather than a guild or, in the more modern term, a labor union. Assistant, associate, full, adjunct, post-doc, graduate instructor, these are just a lot of words to describe a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/08/30/how-two-tier-unions-turn-workers-against-each-other/">two-tier</a> <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-two-tier-union-contracts-became-labors-undoing/">labor</a> <a href="https://www.tdu.org/how_two_tier_contracts_hurt_workers_and_weaken_unions">contract</a>.</p>
   <p>("Scab" is too cruel a word to describe Walsh and all the other adjuncts and postdocs who are victims of a dissolution of worker power they collectively help to perpetuate but did not author. I don't know if anyone has invented an epithet for high-seniority workers who acquiesce to two-tier labor arrangements, but there ought to be a bitter one. It is a deeper form of betrayal, and typically made under less duress, than "scab".)</p>
   <p>Anyway, tempest met teapot. So of course Chris Rufo had to chime in. He <a href="https://x.com/DavidAstinWalsh/status/1795186440701120831">wrote to</a> Walsh:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>There is a redemption arc available to you: tell the truth about DEI and academic corruption. The answer is not to grovel harder — self-abasement is repellent to all factions — but to take a courageous stand against the institutions that have gone astray. Everyone knows that you would have easily earned a faculty position even ten years ago, but the powers that be are pushing through underqualified "race and gender scholars" in all of the humanities departments. Your professional path as the "white male ally" has reached the terminus. Why not tell the truth?</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I find this so amusing. I feel I just have to share.</p>
   <p>Our dear friend Chris Rufo seems to believe as a "truth about DEI and academic corruption" that attempts to increase diversity in academia have led to a decline in standards and faculty quality.</p>
   <p>Chris Rufo should know! He is no mere onlooker. Rufo is the great protagonist of the reconstruction of <a href="2023/02/27/new-college/index.html">my</a> <a href="2023/05/03/we-haunt/index.html">own</a> <em>alma mater</em>, <a href="https://www.ncf.edu/">New College of Florida</a>, which the gentleman is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/opinion/christopher-rufo-diversity-desantis-florida-university.html">restoring to its role</a> under "the classical liberal tradition...produc[ing] scholarship in pursuit of the true, the good and the beautiful."</p>
   <p>Chris Rufo would never try to tilt scales in hiring or recruitment in order to favor some crass ascriptive identity like race or gender.</p>
   <p>Oh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/opinion/columnists/gender-studies-ron-desantis-florida.html">wait</a>.</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Rather than reviving some traditional model of academic excellence, then, it looks as though New College leaders are simply trying to replace a culture they find politically hostile with one meant to be more congenial. The end of gender studies and the special treatment given to incoming athletes are part of the same project, masculinizing a place that had been heavily feminist, artsy and queer. When I spoke to Rufo last weekend, he offered several explanations for New College’s new emphasis on sports, including the classical idea that a healthy body sustains a healthy mind. But an important part of the investment in athletics, he said, is that it is a way to make New College more male and, by extension, less left wing.</p>
    <p>In the past, about two-thirds of New College’s students were women. "This is a wildly out-of-balance student population, and it caused all sorts of cultural problems,” said Rufo. Having so many more women than men, he said, turned New College into “what many have called a social justice ghetto." The new leadership, he said, is “rebalancing the ratio of students” in the hopes of ultimately achieving gender parity.</p>
    <p>But gender parity is not necessarily compatible with a pure academic meritocracy, which Rufo claims to prize.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Earlier in the piece, Michelle Goldberg points out...</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Rufo speaks a lot about academic excellence and the virtues of a classical liberal education. But as Steven Walker of The Sarasota Herald-Tribune <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/education/2023/07/27/new-college-of-florida-pursues-student-athletes-at-academic-cost-richard-corcoran/70445567007/">reported</a> in a damning July story, the incoming class recruited by the new administration has lower average grades, SAT scores and ACT scores than last year’s class. "Much of the drop in average scores can be attributed to incoming student-athletes who, despite scoring worse on average, have earned a disproportionate number of the school’s $10,000-per-year merit-based scholarships," wrote Walker.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I think we all have to concede, Rufo has proven his point. Attempts to remake a college in crass demographic terms can indeed be "corrupt" in the sense of elevating those of "lesser merit" by someone's contestable criteria over people who would be "more deserving" under those measures. And, this kind of ideologically motivated social engineering can be deeply intertwined with <a href="https://www.wusf.org/education/2024-04-12/richard-corcoran-200k-bonus-new-college-of-florida">astonishing</a> <a href="https://ncfcatalyst.com/the-changing-image-of-new-college/">patronage</a> and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/629209-david-rancourt-joins-new-college-as-dean-of-students/">careerism</a>.</p>
   <p>Rufo and his movement seem particularly wedded to rehabilitating masculine virtues, which I unironically applaud. There is indeed a crisis that demands redress surrounding masculinity. Whether we like it or not, males are and will continue to be nearly half of the population. They, like every other minority, deserve to be integrated in all of our institutions. We should acknowledge that the mere fact college-student populations are disproportionately female may not reflect invidious discrimination. Differences in outcome may reflect real differences in aptitude, interest, or ability. But we should treat skeptically claims that groups which underperform today must always underperform due to something inherent in their natures. Sometimes these outcomes reflect systemic, even <em>structural</em>, inhospitabilties entrenched in the institutions where members of the group seem to underperform. If a better developed athletics program helps to make differently gendered students feel more at home at New College, then I am all for it.</p>
   <p>Along with that, I'd encourage embracing the positive aspects of masculinity. Ideals like courage, chivary, and self-reliance.</p>
   <p>A man, for example, when he openly picks a fight, he lands his blows but he accepts that a few blows might also land upon him. At least perhaps glancingly, if at all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WUjgjN7Ssw">upon his shoe</a>).</p>

   <p>Kevin Williams has written a <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/">very good piece</a> about the straight-up superiority of Chinese electric vehicles. When Americans try to understand China's success at industry, they used to think in terms of cheap labor. By now we've come to acknowledge agglomeration effects. China has developed rich "ecosystems", which render proficiencies supportive of their industries effortlessly abundant.</p>
   <p>What Williams' piece highlights is product design. Chinese EVs are just better, cooler, more desirable products than anything Western manufacturers have on offer. That cuts deep. As industry after industry has migrated, many Americans continue to nurse a conceit, encapsulated in Apple's mantra "Designed in California. Assembled in China."</p>
   <p><em>Okay,</em> we like to tell ourselves, <em>our comparative advantage is no longer in fabricating things, with belching smokestacks and fussy labor. Our comparative advantage is the <u>high value</u> part, the <u>creativity</u>. It's fine and sensible that we outsource all the rest.</em></p>
   <p>Among many trenchant observations, Williams' piece notes</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Xiaomi...a phone manufacturer...decided to design and manufacture its own car. Unlike Apple, Xiaomi actually pulled this off, and the end product is so advanced it’s made headlines all over the world.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Apple just can't do what Chinese firms can. As Dan Wang <a href="https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/">has emphasized</a>, production excellence inheres mostly in tacit forms of knowledge that develop only via rich and continuous feedback across every aspect of product development. Apple in California is isolated from processes that should inform and inspire it. Even Einstein would not have been Einstein had there been no physics community into which he could enmesh himself.</p>
   <p>The word "ecosystem" has become something of a commonplace. But as Maria Farrell <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2022/12/08/your-platform-is-not-an-ecosystem/">has pointed out</a>, what the hypemasters of tech call "ecosystems" are better described as plantations. An ecosystem is a chaotic, polycephalic beast. It is a site simultaneously, paradoxically, of competition and collaboration. It is owned or controlled or dominated by no single organism or species. It is an always changing but also self-stabilizing web of interdependence.</p>
   <p>The idea of an "Apple ecosystem" is a contradiction in terms. Apple cannot be an ecosystem. Apple is flailing because it is starved of one.</p>
   <p>The United States is finally trying to reverse its great decline into forms of specialization and trade that lobotomize us. I am very supportive of, and very grateful for, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act">CHIPS Act</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act">Bipartisam Infrastructure Law</a>. But, I fear that rather than developing ecosystems, our political system is more likely to support a few plantations.</p>
   <p>Among the most destructive scandals in recent US history was the kerfuffle over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra">Solyndra</a>. Solyndra was a solar cell startup, to which the Obama Administration <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/solyndra-breaks-ground-new-500mw-solar-panel-plant">guaranteed $535M in loans</a> in 2009. When, unexpectedly, Chinese producers <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices">knocked the floor</a> from beneath solar cell prices, Solyndra's process became uneconomic. The firm went bankrupt in 2011, and the Federal government had to eat a loss.</p>
   <p>The larger program that had funded Solyndra <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/11/13/363572151/after-solyndra-loss-u-s-energy-loan-program-turning-a-profit">did fine</a>, even turned a profit for the Federal government. Without that program, there would likely be no <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/12/29/loan-program-that-funded-solyndra-finds-success-in-tesla-and-many-others/">Tesla</a>. Nevertheless, the embarassment and scandal surrounding Solyndra has discouraged politicians from lending to smaller, less certain ventures ever since.</p>
   <p>We in the United States are counterproductively attached to very simple and immediate forms of state accountability. Every meeting should be open and transparent. Every dollar spent should have a responsible party to blame if, sometime later, we decide that it was spent foolishly or corruptly. An opposing political party and an adversarial press eagerly collude to characterize even the most justifiable choices as corrupt, if in the end they don't work out. It's hard to get people to take a lot of risks under these conditions.</p>
   <p>Subsidy in China is helpfully more diffuse. In addition to overt subsidy (especially on the demand side), China finds ways to subsidize industries without accountable bureaucrats directly cutting checks. The central government simply communicates, widely and forcefully, that it wants effort devoted to an industry. Local governments and state-owned banks do the rest of the work. Local governments collaborate with entrepreneurs to put together ventures. Banks, which are not insulated from politics as Western dogma prescribes, become interested in funding such ventures.</p>
   <p>From <a href="https://ucigcc.org/blog/how-solar-developed-from-the-bottom-up-in-china/">an account of China's solar industry</a> by Jonas Nahm:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The inclusion of solar PV on the list of strategic emerging industries in 2010 and the goals set in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015) for the solar industry greenlighted subnational government plans to support their local solar firms. As a result, China’s solar firms had access to large sums of capital through bank loans, provided by state-owned banks and frequently guaranteed by local government entities or state-owned companies.</p>
    <p>Credit lines to expand manufacturing capacity were brokered and backed by local governments and state-owned firms, even in the years after the global financial crisis when the collapse particularly of European markets led to overcapacity in global solar markets. Providing loans was a way to improve local GDP growth rates, employment rates, and other indicators of economic development used to determine cadre performance and promotions. Solar PV’s status, first as a designated high-technology sector, and, starting in 2010, as a strategic emerging industry in central government plans further encouraged local government officials and state-owned banks to continue lending to China’s solar PV sector.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>There does remain some market discipline. Entrepreneurs still put up their own capital. Banks still try to discriminate between better and worse ventures in targeted industries. The state subsidy takes the form of a coordinated bias in otherwise decentralized decision-making. China's historical success at growing industries through "big pushes" renders applications for finance in a favored domain genuinely superior to similar applications outside of one. A widely shared understanding that <em>this is what we are supposed to be doing</em> limits the downside risk to banks.</p>
   <p>Banks everywhere face soft budget constraints. Whether nonperforming loans must be written off, rendering a bank nakedly undercapitalized, or can be rolled forward is a regulatory choice, not a fact of nature. For banks, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2039.html">accounting is destiny</a>. By treating banks whose lending decisions generally align with state priorities gently, the state subsidizes those banks without ever cutting checks beyond routine lending of reserves to institutions that are deemed to be well capitalized.</p>
   <p>Because local governments more than the central government take the lead in finding or putting together ventures, there are no national Solyndras. Local failures are more forgivable than central failures, from a public perspective. <em>Of course</em> it's the work of local governments to try to make sure our region takes part in the next big industry. Favoritism of central governments is divisive. The public imagines there were many enterprises to choose from, and the best connected got the gravy. But in a local context, the public understands there often simply would not be an enterprise absent tax breaks and loan guarantees. As every American locality that has shoveled out money for a stadium can attest, arguments for development can overmuscle concerns about corruption.</p>
   <p>In this model, there is still eventual accountability. Among the politically well-aligned banks, those who stand out from the pack as bad performers might be made examples of. No matter how cheap the loans, entrepreneurs still stand to lose invested capital. Local governments struggle if tax breaks are never met with offsetting development. Where holes are deepest, officials risk defenestration.</p>
   <p>The "artificial" enthusiasm created by this kind of loose, untitrated subsidy encourages too many entrants, from an orthodox financial perspective. It engenders "overcapacity", vicious price competition, and more eventual failures than would be typical in an "undistorted" business domain.</p>
   <p>But when all is said and done, "inefficient" exuberance is a better problem to have than failing to develop the ecosystems that nuture high-value industries. In a firm-by-firm tally, a lot of money will seem to have been "wasted". But if a competitive, world-class industry emerges, its value to the nation will far outstrip the cost of all the defaulted loans.</p>
   <p><a href="https://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.htm">Ricardo's difficult idea</a> is at best badly incomplete. National prosperity does not derive from merely exploiting comparative advantage, but from ensuring the comparative advantage you exploit is in the highest value industries.</p>
   <p>From national-security perspective, high-value industries reflect globally scarce capabilities. On-shoring them relieves risky dependencies on potentially adversarial powers, and develops a point of likely dependence among trading partners which, if necessary, can be <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/44/1/42/12237/Weaponized-Interdependence-How-Global-Economic">weaponized</a>.</p>
   <p>The fiscal costs of China's indirect subsidies are shrouded, but they are very real. They are buried in arcana on the balance sheets of underperforming banks. They hide in flows from the central to local governments that ensure garbage still gets collected despite tax shortfalls. In drips and increments, most of the costs of failures end up on the central government's balance sheet. But there will have been no scandal, no Solyndra. And, if a globally competitive ecosystem has been seeded, the increment to public debt will be overwhelmed by the industry's contribution to GDP.</p>
   <p>It is unlikely that the United States could adopt China's approach to subsidy directly. In the United States we are obsessively allergic to anything that looks like state corruption, even while we lionize the architects and beneficiaries of every form of private corruption. This set of values does not work to our advantage.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we can try to structure our subsidies to render them more diffuse. We could offer them through states and municipalities, rather than as direct Federal programs. We could offer cheap finance to <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/26/banks-should-fail-much-more-often/index.html">smaller, specialist banks</a> to fund ventures in targeted industries. We could precommit to tallying and evaluating loan guarantee programs in aggregate, telegraph early the expectation of failures, point to the venture capital industry as a model of failure-tolerant success.</p>
   <p>But unlike venture capital, we should expect and tolerate a moderate net loss across the whole portfolio. The goal is not to earn an investment profit, or to hide financial underperformance in positive-but-less-than-market returns we can pretend are still profit. The goal is to jumpstart decentralized, competitive ecosystems in high value, tradable sectors. Which is worth a fiscal cost.</p>

   <p>I think a lot of us have struggled to understand why. Why has Joe Biden been so indulgent with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu?</p>
   <p>Unswerving military support for Israel’s bloody war in Gaza divides Biden’s political coalition, and threatens his narrow electoral path. Of course, Israel is popular in the United States. Biden couldn’t just abandon the ally. If he were optimizing for domestic political support, however, he’d assure Israel’s defense, but also impose much more conditionality, exert much more leverage than he has so far, over both the ends and means of Israel’s campaign. Instead, Biden has chosen to provide full and fully unconditional military support to Israel. He expresses misgivings about Israel’s conduct as though his administration were an uninvolved third party, able to advise but not to constrain. Obviously that’s bizarre. The United States is an essential partner in Israel’s enterprise, not a powerless spectator.</p>
   <p>I have a conjecture to offer. What if Biden’s odd choices are not so much about Israel, but about US policy interests with respect to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, UAE? What if the domestic political costs of Biden’s position are the point, if Biden’s willingness to bear them is a costly signal to the Gulf autocracies that the United States’ commitment not to Israel but to <em>them</em> is “ironclad”?</p>
   <p>Beginning with the George W. Bush administration, but continuing through the Obama years, the United States went a bit mad. At the turn of the millennium and even after 9/11, the United States was the ultimate <em>status quo</em> power. It was, as a French foreign minister <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/news/to-paris-us-looks-like-a-hyperpower.html">put it</a>, the “hyperpower”.</p>
   <p>Ordinarily, a <em>status quo</em> power seeks to impose stability. When you are at the top of the heap, you want to keep the world very much as it is. Provoking revolutions against the <em>status quo</em> is usually the work of “revisionist" powers, who are unhappy with their own place in the pecking order and want to throw over the table to some greater or lesser degree.</p>
   <p>But hyperpower America was a bit drunk not just on its preeminence, but also on its ideals — freedom, democracy, human rights as we deigned to define them. We were the vanguard of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24027184">the end of history</a>, and we were going to hurry the rest of the world into looking much like us. We invaded Afghanistan and Iraq not simply to deter, or to protect our interests narrowly defined, but with a mission to transform those places into Western-style liberal democracies, which by their very natures would not export the kind of terrorism that had provoked us.</p>
   <p>And so, bizarrely, the preeminent power chose to roll the dice on everything, to overturn a very favorable geopolitical <em>status quo</em> and see what might come next.</p>
   <p>Even after its crusades failed, and a new President was elected — in large part because he’d demonstrated sound judgment by opposing the invasion of Iraq — the United States proved an unreliable anchor to the world order. Order, in a real world full of armies, is built upon agreements and alliances between existing, incumbent states. The United States was warmly allied with Hosni Mubarak’s Egypt. It had less warmly but quite actively partnered with Assad’s Syria during the “war on terror”. It had come to an agreement with Muammar Qaddafi, who dismantled Libya’s nuclear program in exchange for ending that country’s pariah status under what was still an American world order.</p>
   <p>And then came the Arab Spring. How could you not be inspired by what was happening in Tahrir Square? God knows I was. I think we all were. When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged caution — Mubarak was a friend, she said — we the people were outraged. Mubarak was a brutal, illiberal, corrupt, nepotistic tyrant. He did not uphold the rights that our ideals declare must be universal. Surely we couldn’t take his side against nonviolent protestors seeking to build a more just and free society?</p>
   <p>We didn’t. President Obama <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clinton-was-right-on-egypt/2016/01/28/fe7fe922-c609-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html">called for Mubarak to accede</a> to the protesters and step aside immediately. Ten days later, Mubarak had resigned. A disorderly “transition to democracy” quickly elected Islamist Mohamed Morsi (echoing the outcome in Gaza years before). Morsi lasted just over a year before some mix of revolution and military coup brought into power Egypt's current leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a figure very much like Mubarak.</p>
   <p>Egypt’s history is not the United States’ to make, but US action can constrain it. Would Mubarak have simply crushed the rebellion absent American constraint? We’ll never know. We do know that when Libya’s Qadaffi prepared to do just that in the country next door, NATO intervened to prevent the crushing. There too the revolution succeeded only to fail. Libya was left not with a Qadaffi clone, but a failed state, a continuing catastrophe by any measure. Qadaffi had made his peace, made a deal, with the West. He had surrendered his nation's nuclear program. But once Western passions about liberatory revolutions and human rights were inflamed, the Libyan government’s claim to sovereignty had to give way. Once again, the <em>status quo</em> power fanned the flames of unpredictable change.</p>
   <p>Putin is reputed to have described the West as “agreement incapable”. I have not been able to source the quote, but the sentiment seems clear in much of Putin’s rhetoric. Qadaffi’s experience underlines the problem. It’s not that the West is cynically duplicitous. (However much Putin likes to claim that too.) It’s that a very impassioned, immediate-term idealism can overwhelm politics in the West, making it impossible for countries like the US to keep commitments when they are needed most, in times of crisis when stability of a partner state requires credible threat of coercive violence. By undermining the credibility of any threat, an international politics of human rights may embolden rebels, and then threat must actually graduate to bloody crushing of the rebellion. Or else fail to do so, often with less-than-liberatory results.</p>
   <p>This risk is particularly acute for states whose order is kept by systems quite different from Western liberal democracy, and quite illegitimate from a Western liberal perspective. If Mohammed bin Salman, a leader most famous for his bone saw, faced a challenge like Qaddaffi faced, could any security commitment by the United States be credible? Americans might object that it should not be! We should not be complicit when a medieval homophobic tyranny crushes dissenters, along undoubtedly with their children and wives and endless other innocents. But should we be chastened at least a bit by the outcomes we’ve observed when we’ve restrained these states’ ability to maintain control?</p>
   <p>Regardless of what should or should not be, the United States is no longer a “hyperpower”. China alone is a near peer power. Geopolitics is again contestable, and becoming terrifyingly contested. The American policy community has belatedly realized it captains a <em>status quo</em> power and must preserve as best it can stability.</p>
   <p>Supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity is an easy lift for us morally, even if it is not militarily. Ukraine is at least aspirationally a Western-style democracy. Its borders were militarily overthrown by an autocratic external aggressor. We can launder our interest in stability through our Western ideals. We experience no ethical dissonance.</p>
   <p>But the Middle East is different. The allies upon whom we rely to superintend a fragile stability are not liberal democracies. Nevertheless, the US has been, and proposes to remain, their security guarantor. It would be a threat to our interests if they allied with our rivals. There may yet be another “spring” when these “tyrannies”, “autocracies” face the same kind of choices Qaddaffi faced in 2011. Can the US and the West be trusted to put alliances and security interests before the passions of their publics? When rebels are cast as Luke Skywalker and our allies as Darth Vader on all the social media, are we as polities even <em>capable</em>, not only of allowing the rebellion to be crushed, but even participating to some degree?</p>
   <p>If we are not, why shouldn’t these rulers prefer countries like China and Russia as security guarantors? China and Russia are demonstrably less precious about these things.</p>
   <p>When Joe Biden began his Presidency, he promised to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state. That was an easy promise. It appealed to Americans' lingering animosities over 9/11 and our aspirations to support human rights. But when Biden had to govern, he realized that the United States needs its problematic allies, and that they have alternatives. Biden’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/15/a-fist-bump-at-the-palace-biden-squares-off-with-mbs-00046106">infamous fistbump</a> was the beginning of a long concession of easy idealism to geopolitical reality. But it was only a beginning. No matter how sincere the Biden administration might be when it makes its deals and promises, when the blood hits the fan, would an American President even be capable of following through?</p>
   <p>And then October 7 happened. A US military ally faced an internal security challenge, and its government was inclined to bloody suppression rather than high-minded diplomacy. As images of dead children rolled in over the weeks and months that followed, US public opinion, particularly within the President’s own political coalition, soon came to favor some kind of ceasefire. Our ally disagreed, and wanted to continue its campaign. Would the outrage of the American public, or the risk of losing Michigan, force the administration to constrain rather than support its ally? If that outrage bleeds into civil unrest would the administration blink?</p>
   <p>My conjecture is that America’s Israel / Palestine policy since October 7 has, at least in part, been a long fistbump to America’s less democratic partners. Can the United States, under a Democratic administration, be trusted when its security commitments demand support of highly visible, politically difficult brutality?</p>
   <p>Yes we can.</p>

   <p>When they come to murder me, when they come to murder my child, we will not care in whose name it is done. We will not be martyrs. We will just be dead.</p>
   <p>Today no one murders my family, but in Gaza families await their murder.</p>
   <p>I will not chant <code>#FreePalestine</code>.</p>
   <p>The Palestinian national project is rancid. The Israeli national project is rancid. Each is Yin to the other's Yang. Israel's foundation as an aspirational ethnostate, Palestinian adoption of the same <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/10/13/national-self-determination-is-a-vicious-idea/index.html">national liberation self-determination bullshit</a>, first time in tragedy, second time as deadly farce. Imitation can be the most brutal form of flattery.</p>
   <p>I am for the British Mandate.</p>
   <p>Alas, I fear the inward-looking Brits will probably shirk the obligations centuries of empire might still impose.</p>
   <p>I am for the caliphate — Abbasid, not ISIS — which governed with sufficient liberality that even Jews could thrive.</p>
   <p>But we've waited a millennium for its return, and may wait a millennium more.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, for Israel and Palestine — two political communities, each sprung from the deadly stupid seed of national self-determination, each deformed ever more deeply by escalating rounds of murder and revenge, each correctly certain the other would annihilate it before granting what it takes to be its rights — the stupidest prescription is autonomy. "Freedom."</p>
   <p>Don't <code>#FreePalestine</code>.</p>
   <p><code>#ShackleIsrael</code>.</p>
   <p>What these two political communities require is restraint. Coercion. Subjection, until they reform themselves mutually into a political community that would enforce the rights of all residents of the territory they must share, and find ways to undo the damage they have done to themselves and one another and the world.</p>
   <p>While the caliphate is not and the Brits comfort their troubled king, the only empire on hand is a very compromised alliance of the United States and its autocratic Arab allies.</p>
   <p>We Americans like to comfort ourselves in world affairs that we are on the side of freedom and democracy, against some axis — it is always an axis — of autocrats and totalitarians.</p>
   <p>That's a dumb framing. We might squint and get away with it in Europe, but throughout the "global South" our allies have never been human-rights liberals. They certainly are not now.</p>
   <p>What we can be is for stability. And against murder.</p>
   <p>On the first, no accusation of hypocrisy can stick. We really don't want borders revised by force. We are done fomenting revolutions. In the Middle East, we might hope liberal democracy will emerge from autocratic stability, as it did in Taiwan and South Korea. But it's clear we prioritize the stability. Whatever else you might say about the Biden administration's handling of Israel-Palestine, it has worked assiduously to maintain alignment within its coalition, despite profound opposition among our allies' publics. The administration strives and has succeeded remarkably to contain the regionwide catastrophe a broad war against Iran and its proxies would bring. The United States is for stability.</p>
   <p>We have not stood so assiduously against murder, however. The character of Israel's actions in Gaza cannot escape that ugly word. However many roofs are knocked or pamphlets dropped, when it has become routine to <a href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/">blow up families when daddy's home</a> because daddy might have some junior-level connection to Hamas, you have gone past war to murder. Once you are, to put it generously, failing to protect aid workers in territories you control, when you know that absent assistance thousands will die of famine, you become guilty of their starvation.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, there were glimmers of hope that the United States would impose restraint. President Biden was to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-predicts-come-jesus-meeting-with-netanyahu-over-gaza-aid-2024-03-08/">provide</a> Bibi Netanyahu a "come-to-Jesus moment" over humanitarian concerns in Gaza. (Perhaps that was an unfortunate turn of phrase.) The US was going to construct a pier in Gaza for aid deliveries, the very presence of which might serve as a kind of tripwire. ("Mistakes" that kill aid workers who come straight out of US military facilities would be intolerable.) The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/michigans-strong-uncommitted-vote-shows-israel-impact-biden-support-2024-02-28/">campaign for "uncommitted"</a> in Democratic primaries brilliantly demonstrated the political risks Biden faced if he did not impose greater restraint upon Israel. When World Central Kitchen aid workers were <a href="https://wck.org/news/gaza-team-update">killed</a> in the sort of mistake that reflects such tremendous incaution it blurs with intention, Biden finally did have a "tough" <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-approves-reopening-erez-crossing-into-gaza-use-ashdod-port-aid-2024-04-05/">phone call</a> with Netanyahu, who quickly promised new pathways for aid to Northern Gaza. An invasion of Rafah, the last refuge for Gaza's civilian population, was to be a "red line".</p>
   <p>It wasn't much, but it was a start.</p>
   <p>Then Israel bombed an Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria, and Iran sent a barage of missiles and drones into Israel, and the plight of Gazans was forgotten. Political incentives which had been building to restrain Israel were overwhelmed by incentives to stand by Israel against a chronic common foe.</p>
   <p>Astonishingly — I think to the great credit of the Biden administration — the near conflict with Iran was deescalated. Pressure on behalf of the people of Gaza would, I thought, resume.</p>
   <p>It has not. On the contrary.</p>
   <p>In what would be a brilliant stroke of <a href="https://www.middle-east-info.org/take/wujshasbara.pdf">hasbara</a>, had Israel's brutal government not simply gotten lucky, American headlines became dominated by protests "in solidarity with Gaza" at US universities. As usual, press coverage of protests focuses on what is extreme, rather than what is representative. Then, <a href="https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/the-only-thing-university-administrators">incredibly dumb crackdowns</a> by careerist university administrators transformed the protests into battlegrounds of the United States' culture wars, rather than anything to do with people who might be bombed in Rafah or starved in Gaza City.</p>
   <p>For a variety of reasons — some fair, some not — the incentives these protests created for most politicians is to distance themselves from the protestors' cause. The people demonstrating in solidarity with Gaza have unwittingly rendered it toxic for US politicians to take risks on behalf of the people of Gaza.</p>
   <p>There are times when disruptive, oppositional forms of protest serve a cause. But there are times when the same acts undermine it. The protestors are in the right, with respect to the American controversy over free speech. Protestors have every right to express themselves, and universities should be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jacobtlevy.bsky.social/post/3kqlhkszozc2x">extraordinarily tolerant</a> of student expression, even when it notionally violates rules. Though there are undoubtedly extremists and idiots, claims that protests against Israel or for Palestinians are antisemitic or render campuses "unsafe" for Jews are mostly bullshit. Universities should err on the side of tolerating speech rather than psychological "safety".</p>
   <p>(<em>Tu quoques</em> on the political right are correct when they point out this ethos was often not respected on university campuses when psychological "safety" claims were asserted on behalf of groups other than Jews. They are right. That was wrong. They are still <em>quoques</em>.)</p>
   <p>The protestors have every right to protest in this way. But they should not. They are harming the cause they ostensibly support, if that cause is saving lives in Gaza. If the cause they support is a kind of accelerationism, under which Palestinian "martyrdom" is worth the price if it undermines Israel's legitimacy in favor of a Palestinian national project, then they should keep doing exactly what they are doing.</p>
   <p>I have a higher opinion of the protestors than that. I think they are protesting in order to end Israel's atrocities — in Gaza, and in the West Bank and in Jerusalem — not because they are devoted fellow travelers of a Palestinian national project. I think many protestors have not taken the time to think through the distinction. I beg them to do it now.</p>
   <p>The Biden administration faces no urgency to build that humanitarian pier, which was already supposed to have been built. It is under little pressure to threaten to withold weaponry, when Israel has already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-intensifies-strikes-gazas-rafah-ahead-threatened-invasion-2024-04-25/">begun to bomb</a> Rafah, perhaps in preparation for a misadventure.</p>
   <p>Six weeks ago, the administration was under a great deal of pressure. First Iran, and now student protests, have changed the equation.</p>
   <p>My dear protestors, what the administrations — of Columbia University, of the United States of America — want now is just to distance themselves from you.</p>
   <p>Often, as protestors, the goal is to get into the spotlight. If what you do is not spectacular, disruptive, then even if many thousands protest, media mostly ignore you. Politicians ignore you. So what is the point?</p>
   <p>But sometimes you need to get out of the spotlight.</p>
   <p>Sometimes your work is to do everything you can to put the spotlight where it belongs, on people who are starving, on the families who may soon be murdered if whatever happens in Rafah occurs with the same respect for civilian life that was shown in Khan Younis and Gaza City.</p>
   <p>While we are arguing over Columbia and NYU and NYPD, while we are talking about 1968 and another Democratic convention in Chicago, we are, to use the lingo, erasing the people whose lives are at risk. The people who might literally be erased.</p>
