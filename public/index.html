  <h1><a href="2023/05/03/we-haunt/index.html">We haunt</a></h1>
 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Everywhere the humans have been, and especially everywhere the humans still are, there are ghosts. We haunt. There is nothing more fundamental. We leave bits of us — artifacts, fragments of memory, graffiti, letters, legends — everywhere that we have been. Those traces reanimate, like Sea Monkey eggs poured into brine, among humans who eventually encounter them. Things long dormant come to life.</p>
   <p>They can raze the Pei Dormitories and rechristen New College "DeSantis University". They can exile the the faculty and recruit chidren raised by televangelists. They can scrub every surface with bleach and hydroxychloroquine, desperate to erase any trace of us.</p>
   <p>But we who <a href="2023/02/27/new-college/index.html">are now dead</a>, we lived there. We loved there. We lived brief lives so extraordinary there that the rest of the world, the rest of our own lives, faded dim. That cannot be erased.</p>
   <p>It won't be.</p>
   <p>As long as there is a college of any kind on that remarkable, beautiful campus, as long as there are kids who live there and a community striving to teach and learn, there will be resonances. The collective adolescence will draw our poltergeist.</p>
   <p>Even now, our usurpers live only in our negative spaces. Or in weak caricatures of our negative spaces that their own smallness and madness have hallucinated for them. Pity them. They make so much noise, they stomp gleefully upon the wildflowers. But despite their professed religion, no spirit stirs beneath their ruckus. They croak sound with no echoes. Their footprints are nothing to time and wind. Wildflowers grow back, thick in bright colors, from detritus of root and seed.</p>
   <p>Haunt. Small men in large pulpits come and go. There have never been smaller men than these.</p>
   <p>Haunt. Tell our stories. Leave traces, sprinkle breadcrumbs, in these electric entrails we now inhabit. In places where they can find them, not in the ever-shifting self-eradicating folds of Mark Zuckerberg's gigabit anus.</p>
   <p>What we leave, the kids will find. They will want to know. The transcendant is rare in our difficult country. New College is a wellspring. Children whose upbringing has been constraint masquerading as rapture, cruelty masquerading as civilization, threat masquerading as sanctuary, will thirst all the more for the water.</p>
   <p><em>Trustees</em>, they call themselves, as if anyone would trust them. <em>President</em>. How grand. These people are parade floats transecting only briefly the center of the universe. Vulgar, imposing, made of nothing but hot air smelling stale like sweat and fear. We have indulged them too much already with diplomacy and outrage, with any kind of attention at all. They are unworthy of attention at all.</p>
   <p>Haunt.</p>
   <p>And stay, if you can. Whether you are student, staff, or faculty, it will be a trial. But an even better medium for haunting than an abandonned house is a living body possessed by spirit and memory. By no means give those motherfuckers any money. But if you can stand it, if you can put up with their harrying and petulence and dishonesty and cruelty, stay. A river runs through you.</p>
   <p>And love. The kids who will come, whether they are recruited on baseball scholarships or from community colleges (a <a href="https://www.ncf.edu/admissions/transfer-students/guaranteed-admission/">genuinely wonderful initiative</a>) or whether they are our own kids, the kids are not our enemy. They are us and we are them. As long as they live and learn as fully and richly and wildly as we did, nothing can be lost. Flickering in a windstorm conjured by fools, we offer a flame. Only we know its warmth and technicolor brilliance. We offer it in love, despite the gusts and gales.</p>
   <p>It won't be easy for these new kids either. This storm is meant to keep them pliantly in their shelters.</p>
   <p>We were not so pliant. Neither will they be.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Systemic questions are boring.</p>
   <p>It is so much more fun when we have a scandal — corruption! sex! ‐ than to drone on about our voting system. A scandal brings excitement, outrage, food fights on Twitter, entertaining cable news. Who the fuck cares about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger's_law">Duverger's Law</a> and <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a>?</p>
   <p>But Jesus Fucking Christ.</p>
   <p>We all understand that, in the United States, our current electoral system reliably elevates sociopaths. Then we are shocked!, shocked! that they are sociopaths.</p>
   <p>Our electoral system rewards — nay, requires — corruption, as without campaign cash, most candidates have no hope.</p>
   <p>The primary system and the small-money donations game filter for outrage entrepreneurs. The big-money donations game filters for sycophants to plutocrats. Pick your poison, then poison us all.</p>
   <p>Donald Trump is not the problem. He's a symptom. As are the prosecutorial showboats like Adam Schiff who oh so valiantly attack him. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1478929920963827">Kayfabe</a> was the metaphor, but it's wrong to imagine it started with Trump.</p>
   <p>Whatever these people are doing, they are not meaningfully representing us. They are not finding solutions to the problems that most vex us. There's a <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/groucho_marx_122546">Groucho Marx</a> aspect to our current system. Anyone willing to do what it takes to get elected and keep the job under our decayed institutions is unlikely to do the job well.</p>
   <p>And we are misgoverned. We are so badly misgoverned. We are <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/25/1164819944/live-free-and-die-the-sad-state-of-u-s-life-expectancy">literally dying</a> from misgovernment. It's a big fucking deal.</p>
   <p>Giving your sociopaths a slim margin over the other team of sociopaths is not going to solve the problem. There is no one you can elect who will "make a difference" when the system in which they operate is what's broken. The only way they can make a difference is if they change the system that rewards their misgovernment.</p>
   <p>Yes, it matters, as a kind of holding action, that the very worst of them shouldn't get elected. But all the money we send to ActBlue or WinRed is just a fucking shakedown. The <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7759.html">politics industry</a> finances itself opulently by holding us for ransom. We are provoked to pay so that something terrible won't happen.</p>
   <p>Not a lot of positive good is likely to come out of a <a href="2023/04/21/two-parties-make-us-stupid/index.html">cage match</a> between two sorted, polarized parties, from which we elect representatives whose main job is attracting cash, for whom governing is at best a side hustle, and who understand that taking a meaningful position beyond the consensus of their party invites attack ads and is electoral poison.</p>
   <p>Things work a little better than you'd expect from a fair description of our actual system. Maybe there's some hope in that. But not very much hope.</p>
   <p>We have to change the structure of our democracy.</p>
   <p>We are in a foreign policy environment where catastrophically destructive war or even nuclear annihilation are plausible outcomes. We need to act with care, deliberation, and wisdom. Instead, political incentives militate either towards cartoon hawkishness or dogmatic isolationism, almost regardless of the actual circumstances. We need leaders who can actually negotiate and deliberate, who can understand nuance and consider compromise without those words becoming euphemisms for abandonning vital commitments.</p>
   <p>We have to change the structure of our democracy.</p>
   <p>And we can! Yes we can! Almost none of what ails us is embedded in our hard-to-change Constitution.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><p>If our pustulent rotted Congress could rise above their pustulence and rottedness for a day or two, they could change the character of the antidemocratic Senate. It could become a body that elevates broadly popular, consensus-oriented statesmen rather than partisan sociopaths. It would take nothing more than an Act of Congress to <a href="2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">insist</a> that Senators be elected by approval vote.</p></li>
    <li><p>A simple Act of Congress <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">could ensure</a> that at least four major parties emerge among the public and take seats in the House of Representatives, transforming today's stalemated trench warfare between implacably opposed camps into a more constructive dynamic where parties on their own can neither pass or block anything, where coalition building works while kneecapping a rival just advantages a different rival.</p></li>
    <li><p>We could insist that elections be solely publicly financed.</p></li>
    <li><p>We could properly fund Congressional staffs so they needn't outsource the basic work of legislating to think tanks bought by plutocrats and lobbyists working for industries eager to write their own laws.</p></li>
    <li><p>We could even <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7964.html">build a Supreme Court</a> that would be trustworthy.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Any of these things, or all of them, could be accomplished by a simple Act of Congress.</p>
   <p>Structure may not be as salacious as who's grabbing whom by the pussy, who bought whom by some clever <a href="https://elk.zone/fosstodon.org/@interfluidity/110273134173554579">or not so clever</a> means that the Supreme Court decides is not corruption.</p>
   <p>Something in our lizard brains seeks out human villains we can mock, punish, destroy. Structural change is not so exciting. It seems dry.</p>
   <p>But it is so much more powerful. Transcend your lizard blame for a second, and prioritize what fucking matters. With enough pressure, even the sociopaths we currently elect can be cornered into doing the right thing.</p>

  <h1><a href="2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">Two kinds of representation</a></h1>
 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>In conversations about democratic institutions, I wish we would be clearer about two, very different kinds of representation.</p>
   <p>Sometimes, we want one single person to represent an entire diverse public. In the United States, when we elect a president, he or she must look after the interests of all Americans. When we elect a senator, that person's job is to represent the state in its entirety, rather than any faction or party. Let's call this "one-for-all" representation.</p>
   <p>Sometimes, we define representative <em>bodies</em> whose role is to serve as "minipublics". In the US, the House of Representatives is the most prominent example. In a representative minipublic, the role of an individual member is not to stand for everyone, but to represent a particular faction or party. Here what representation means is to <em>include</em>, in roughly proportionate numbers, members of <em>every</em> faction and party. Let's call this "everybody-in" representation.</p>
   <p>These two kinds of representation are profoundly different. Any conversation about electoral systems that fails to recognize this will be stunted from the start.</p>
   <p>It is great and right that somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene sits in the House of Representatives. At least 1% of the US public shares her rather particular take on things, so there should be at least four Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-ish Representatives in the US House.</p>
   <p>I don't like her views. But that's precisely why I need her there. Because my political system can only be legitimate if it includes and enfranchises the factions I like least. If only people whose politics I consider sane are represented, then our claim to pluralism is a sham. A system where those beyond some faction's definition of the pale are shut out by self-appointed moral betters would not be liberal democracy. It's on all of us, by some combination of persuasion, community, and actually good governance to ensure that our worst fringes gain very limited support in the population, so that we can give them full representation in our institutions, genuinely take their concerns into consideration, and still govern well. I am genuinely grateful for the role Marjorie Taylor Greene plays in the House of Representatives.</p>
   <p>But a person like Marjorie Taylor Greene should never sit in the Senate. Even if 51% of voters in the state of Georgia absolutely <em>love</em> Marjorie Taylor Greene, so long as most of the other 49% feel about her politics the way, well, I do, she could not possibly represent the interests of the state of Georgia writ large.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, under our current electoral system, she certainly would be elected senator with those numbers. That is a mistake.</p>
   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting">Plurality voting</a>, how we mostly elect people in the United States, is an awful way to decide which single person will represent a whole body of people. Rather than choosing a representative for everyone, it sets up a factional contest over who will be represented at all, and who will be ignored or worse.</p>
   <p>Plurality voting is a bad voting system for almost any purpose. But, as the American <em>status quo</em>, it is not <em>as</em> bad for the House of Representatives as it is for other offices. In each Congressional district, some factional champion will win, and other factions will be shut out. But what matters most is the composition of the House as a whole, not who wins a particular district. If (in the <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">destructive</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/21/two-parties-make-us-stupid/index.html">binary</a> that plurality voting encourages) 60% of the public belongs to one faction and 40% to another, and if 60% of the factional battles are won by the larger faction and 40% by the smaller, then the chamber will be representative, even though in each district many individuals won't be meaningfully represented by "their" representative. Our assumption of proportional victories is a pretty big "if", and we know that partisan gerrymandering exists precisely to render it false. But when we want "everybody-in" representation, it's at least <em>possible</em> for plurality voting to yield not-ridiculously-disproportionate outcomes.</p>
   <p>When we want "one-for-all" representation, however, when we are electing presidents or senators or governors or mayors, plurality voting is viciously inadequate. It's not just a stump speech: If we are to have a functioning democracy, especially during periods of dissensus and polarization, we really do need a person who can be president "not of Red America, not of Blue America, but of the United States of America".</p>
   <p>At all levels of government, we want executives who can straddle factional lines and work with everybody, people who may be no faction's first choice but whom everyone can live with. The factional contest that plurality voting sets up is entirely inappropriate to "one-for-all" representation. If it is even remotely plausible that a faction can win an election by "turning out the base" (meaning exciting the most committed factionalists even where that might turn-off many outsiders), then you have an electoral system that threatens to deliver something between disenfranchisement and tyranny to the factions that lose the election.</p>
   <p>This is the American <em>status quo</em>. One minute our democracy is under threat by Donald Trump, the next minute we are living under the "Biden regime". In either case, half the country feels disenfranchised and threatened, because so much of the power of the state becomes concentrated in the hands of a dedicated factionalist whose faction they oppose.</p>
   <p>We don't need to repeal the Constitution to fix this. We just need to understand the different kinds of representation inherent in different Constitutional offices, and tailor our election rules accordingly. General elections for President and Senator, in every state, should be by <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a>, or some very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_voting">similar</a> system. Elections for the House of Representatives should be conducted under any of the many systems that reliably deliver <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">proportional representation</a> and are resistant to gerrymandering.</p>
   <p>At the state and local levels, just like at the Federal level, we should always begin by asking of each elected position, are we electing "one-for-all" — one person to represent everyone — or are we constituting a body that should include advocates of every viewpoint or faction, "everybody-in"?</p>
   <p>And when we find ourselves in arguments about what would be "the best" electoral system, we should remember that we'll need at least two, for these two very different kinds of representation.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Why do we want democracy anyway?</p>
   <p>There are two intertwined goods that we hope democracy will deliver:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Democracy legitimates government action.</strong> If we believe that what our government does has been decided by and for the public as a whole, rather than by and to the advantage of some elite or faction, then we are likely to concede that it's legitimate. We're less likely to resist, whether by quietly defying the law when we can get away with it or overtly struggling against the state.</p> <p>Legitimacy is both a <em>per se</em> good and an instrumental good. If we think the system we live under is legitimate, that fact alone makes us feel better about our lives than if we think we think we are coerced by a corrupt and oppressive state. More than that, legitimacy renders us all more willing to behave in ways that make state action more likely to succeed, and so improves social coordination and enhances state capacity.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Democracy enables high quality decision-making.</strong> A tyranny or aristocracy will act with limited access to the values and interests of the public it governs, and will often project its own perspectives and interests on the broader public. So even when it means to act in the public interest, it will fail to do so. No faction has a monopoly on insight, and every faction has blind spots, prejudices, and parochial concerns. Democracy — in theory, at its best — would recruit the entire public into an intelligent process of deliberation, yielding higher quality decisions than any faction governing alone would arrive at.</p></li>
   </ol>
   <p>These goods are mutually reinforcing. A state that consistently makes high quality decisions will be perceived as more legitimate than one that seems always to err. When state action is widely held to be legitimate, public cooperation will expand the range of choices the government can succeed at executing, enabling a higher quality of decisions than a government whose actions will be stymied by public torpor or active resistence.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, a system that divides the public into two aggressively competing, highly cohesive factions renders an intelligent process of deliberation impossible. It is not hard to understand why.</p>
   <p>Intelligent deliberation requires that there exist some agent capable of weighing competing ideas without too much prejudice. It is fine — it is necessary! — that there are passionate interests on one side or another of any debate. But passionate interests don't deliberate. They advocate.</p>
   <p>You can't make a court only from the prosecution and the defense. Who would listen and synthesize the evidence? The prosecution and defense have their roles to play. But deliberation is only effective when there are judges and juries beholden to neither side, able to consider competing claims on their merits.</p>
   <p>Of course we will never achieve perfect neutality, objectivity, fairness, independence in our fallen human world. But these characteristics can exist in importantly different degrees. Institutions that create space for neutral-ish adjudicating parties will be capable of better decisionmaking than institutions under which prejudiced parties simply struggle for the power to impose their own way.</p>
   <p>When a society becomes polarized into only two competing factions, each of which takes opposite sides over the set of issues under public contestation, there cease to be neutral-ish parties. Each faction will learn to punish deviance by individuals within its orbit, because dissent on any of the portfolio of positions one faction has adopted weakens the faction as a political coalition. A two-party system risks converging over time into highly disciplined coalitions, because tolerating dissent within a party creates opportunities for the other, much worse, party to exploit.</p>
   <p>A two-party system is a zero-sum game. Whatever weakens my side, strengthens the other side. Matters that should be decided with attention to actual facts about the world become subsumed by concerns over who will be helped and who will be hurt by a given position. No issue, individually, can outweigh the catastrophe that would result if the other side achieved greater power, so neither party can afford to consider any issue on its merits at all. The implcations with regard to <em>who</em> will rule wholly outweigh questions of <em>what</em> should best be done.</p>
   <p>In a multiparty system, on any given question, there may be factions without much skin in the game. The environmentally-focused Green Party may not have strong priors about education reforms, and may not perceive its own electoral prospects as being very connected to that issue. If that is so, members of the Green Party can actually consider those questions on the merits, perhaps adjudicating some controversy between a labor party committed to teachers' interests as workers and a liberal party trying to maximize efficiencies by minimizing expenditures. On any given issue, you'd ideally like the deciding "swing" party to have minimal commitments, to be capable of listening to advocates and forming independent judgments.</p>
   <p>Multiple parties alone cannot guarantee this, of course. If parties tightly align to form a governing coalition, then our hypthetical Green Party might just defer to its coalition partner. And what is formally a two party system need not foreclose the possibility of space for neutral-ish factions. In the United States, before our two parties had sorted themselves so well into homogenous, disciplined entities, the existence of "Rockefeller Republicans" and conservative Southern Democrats meant that beneath the party brands sat a multiplicity of groups, whose positions in controversies often failed to hew to party lines.</p>
   <p>Intelligent decisionmaking under democracy is less a matter of the number of formal political parties participate and more a question of how fluid coalitions among factions are. If every question is going to be settled in Democrats-vs-Republicans terms, you will have a stupid polity. If party discipline is weak and factions shift, so that on any given question less interested factions take positions largely on their merits, you might manage an intelligent polity even with only two formal parties.</p>
   <p>What matters is that there be sufficient diversity and fluidity within the legislature that the swing vote usually comes from factions that has no strong, prior interest in the question considered, and no binding loyalty to any of the more interested factions. For any given question, there needs to be a judge and jury, as well as a prosecution and defense, among the legislature.</p>
   <p>The political science consensus, I think, is that parliamentary systems under which the executive is selected by the legislature are superior to US-style presidential systems. Parliamentary systems reduce the danger of paralyzing, destructive, conflict between legislature and president, both of which claim a mandate from the people.</p>
   <p>The argument I make here runs a bit contrary to this consensus. When a governing coalition must be maintained within the legislature, even if there are formally mutiple parties, the parliament risks becoming effectively a two-party chamber, defined by those who are in government and those who are in opposition. Under a presidential system, discipline within the legislature need not be maintained in order to sustain control of the executive. Parties not attached to strong coalitions can afford more independence of judgment, creating space for meaningful fluidity and neutrality inside the legislature.</p>
   <p>However, in order to reduce conflict between a fluid and deliberative legislature and an externally chosen executive, the president should be elected via a system likely to elevate more neutral and diplomatic candidates, rather than committed factionalists.</p>
   <p>If I could wave a magic wand, the United States President would be elected by <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a>, which tends to elevate consensus candidates. The House of Representatives would be chosen by some form of proportional representation, designed — because the structure of the system does determine these things! — to elevate four to six political parties. Multiplicity of formal party may not guarantee a fluid multiplicity of faction. But it would help encourage it, and break the cul-de-sac of strongly sorted, binary factions in which the US is now stuck. (Senators, who are charged with representing whole vast states, should also be elected by approval voting. They should be consensus figures, people nearly all of their constituents can live with, rather than factionalists who alienate half their publics.)</p>
   <p>Our current system and situation render deliberation a sham in the service of factional power. This makes us collectively stupid. Which discredits our democracy, and the very idea of democracy.</p>
   <p>If you want to save democracy, it's not enough to fight the authoritarians in the other party, whichever party you now identify with. We have to reform our electoral system.</p>
   <hr>
   <p>p.s. I usually recommend <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">Lee Drutman's book</a> on this stuff, and see no reason not to recommend it again now.</p>

  <h1><a href="2023/04/18/taiwan/index.html">Taiwan</a></h1>
 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Taiwan's status has settled into a kind of pissing match between the United States and China. I think this is very bad.</p>
   <p>From an American perspective, Xi Jinping's China seems increasingly assertive, impatient, and threatening. US officials publicly worry that China might blockade or invade Taiwan <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/753bec2b-9c55-49a8-9d34-7c286af505f3">at any time</a>.</p>
   <p>From a Chinese perspective, the United States seems to be openly flouting its "one China" policy under which the United States <a href="http://www.taiwandocuments.org/communique03.htm">claimed</a> to have "no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China's internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan.'"</p>
   <p>When senior US officials make high-profile public visits to Taiwan, that is perceived almost universally — within China, but also by American and Western publics — as supporting a posture of adversarial defiance by Taiwan towards China. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vive_le_Qu%C3%A9bec_libre">(Vive le Québec libre!)</a> Given increasingly negative perceptions of China's behavior with respect to Xinjiang and Hong Kong, supporting Taiwanese resistance is popular with Western publics and therefore attractive to Western politicians. Of course, members of the US Congress and Taiwanese leaders have every right to meet with one another, wherever they wish, without regard to China's views on the matter.</p>
   <p>That one has a right to do a thing, however, does not imply that it's a righteous thing to do. Asserting ones rights should in general be a last, rather than first, resort. In ordinary life, nearly all of the time, we try to act with sufficient consideration of those our actions might affect that the question of rights never comes up. We assert rights only when someone will object, but we decide to act anyway.</p>
   <p>It is important that we can and do assert rights, that we have liberties that can overcome other peoples' objections. But it's also wise, when it is possible, to try to address people's concerns rather than jumping directly to an adversarial assertion of rights. Even when in the end no agreement can be reached and ultimately we do assert rights, the exercise of having made a real attempt — of expressing some regret rather than just glee when we disregard another's preference — goes some way towards mitigating the damage.</p>
   <p>As readers can tell, I view events like Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan more through a lens of destructive showboating than courageous freedom fighting. I care a great deal about Taiwan's continuing freedom and prosperity, and don't think the United States should in any sense shirk its commitments to the island. But our commitment should be to chart a course that will actually, rather than symbolically, support the welfare of Taiwan. The way relations between the United States and China have spiraled makes a destructive war too likely. The goal of the United States should be live up to our commitments in a way that prevents such a war.</p>
   <p>The keystone of the United States' policy with respect to Taiwan should be <em>mutuality</em>. Our position should be that we support any change in Taiwan's status so long as it is voluntarily agreed by both China's government and the <em>de facto</em> government of Taiwan. <em>Voluntarily</em> is important. The United States supports Taiwan, militarily and otherwise, only so that it cannot be coerced by China. If, at some point in the future, a convergence occurs so that China and Taiwan become ready to conclude a "peaceful reunification", that would be wonderful. If, in some future, friendly and mutually beneficial cross-strait relations lead China to become less concerned with exerting formal sovereignty over Taiwan and the parties jointly negotiate a more autonomous status for the island, that would be great too.</p>
   <p>What the United States should oppose is any unilateral or coercive change in status, by either party. If China were to try to take Taiwan by force, there is little question now, and there should be little question, that the United States would intervene in the island's defense. That would be a catastrophe for all concerned, but the logic of deterrence demands risking catastophe. Especially in the wake of the Ukraine experience, I (like Joe Biden) don't see much benefit in "strategic ambiguity". The worst kind of deterrence is a policy sufficiently uncertain that the party you seek to deter risks adventure, but sufficiently serious that when it does you end up expending treasure or blood or maybe provoking an apocalypse in response. Deterrence strikes me as a Yoda-esque affair. Do, or do not.</p>
   <p>Even while we deter China, the United States should make clear, plainly and publicly, that we would not support, would not recognize, and would not defend Taiwan in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence. Does the US ever say this? Seems like an obvious thing. It is not, as China frequently implies, the United States' policy to encourage separatism in Taiwan. The United States should forthrightly and frequently say so.</p>
   <p>On questions like how Taiwan's economic and cultural interests should be represented in multilateral organizations and around the world, the United States should encourage negotiation and consensus rather than take sides in symbolic but inflammatory pissing matches. Where China cannot be appeased, the United States should informally intermediate, so that Taiwan's substantive concerns can be addressed even where it lacks a formal role.</p>
   <p>Our principled stance should be mutuality. Whatever the parties mutually agree, we are down with. While there is not mutual agreement, the <em>status quo</em> must be preserved. The fundamental position of the United States should be insistance that neither party act unilaterally or coerce the other.</p>
   <p>For the forseeable future, no agreement is likely, so the parties will have to be patient. An awkward peace is so much better than the alternative. As decades pass, everything will change, in ways we cannot now foresee. Someday the parties will agree. We should all look forward to that.</p>
