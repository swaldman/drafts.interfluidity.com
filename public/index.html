 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>The virtues of a market economy derive largely from competition. But for many goods and services, it is almost incoherent to talk about competitive provision.</p>
   <p>As J. W. Mason <a href="https://jwmason.org/slackwire/in-praise-of-profiteering/">explains</a> (ht <a href="https://wealtheconomics.substack.com/">Steve Roth</a>):</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The usual situation in a modern economy...is flat or declining marginal costs. Non-increasing marginal costs, nonzero fixed costs, and competitive pricing cannot coexist: In the absence of increasing marginal costs, a price equal to marginal cost leaves nothing to cover fixed costs. Modern industries, which invariably involve substantial fixed costs and flat or declining marginal costs at normal levels of output, require some degree of monopoly power in order to survive. This is the economic logic behind patents and copyrights — developing a new idea is costly, but disseminating it is cheap. So if we are relying on private businesses for this, they must be granted some degree of monopoly.</p>
    <p>The problem is, once we agree that some degree of market power is necessary in order for industries without declining returns to cover their fixed costs, how do we know how much market power is enough? Too much market power, and firms can make super-normal profits by holding prices above the level required to cover their costs, reducing access to whatever social useful thing they supply. Too little market power, and competing firms will be inefficiently small, drive each other to bankruptcy, or simply decline to enter, depriving society of the useful thing entirely. Returning to the IP example: To the extent that copyrights and patents serve an economic function, it is possible for them to be either too long or too short.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>One way or another, the answer to this conundrum of high fixed costs, low variable costs, is and always has been state subsidy.</p>
   <p>What are copyrights and patents, really? Here's <a href="https://cepr.net/debts-deficits-and-patent-monopolies/">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>At the most basic level, we have to understand that patent (and copyright) monopolies are a way the government pays for things it wants. Instead of using government funds to pay drug companies to develop new drugs and vaccines, we reward them with a patent monopoly...</p>
    <p>In the government’s accounting, we treat patent monopolies and spending very differently. The grant of a patent monopoly does not appear in the government’s budget, so we can award these monopolies as an alternative to direct spending if we want the deficit to appear smaller.</p>
    <p>We sometimes have literally gone this route of using a patent monopoly, or an equivalent grant of exclusivity, as a substitute to direct spending. In the case of prescription drugs, in order to get drug companies to do pediatric trials, the government will award a company a six-month period of exclusivity, beyond any patent duration, in order to pay for the trial.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The government could just pay the money directly for the pediatric trial, but this would be a direct expenditure that adds to the deficit. If instead it adds six months to a patent, the company is paid by being able to charge higher drug prices for this period. In effect, the government is allowing the company to tax patients to cover the cost of the trial...</p>
    <p>The idea of selling the ability to tax is not new. Centuries ago, it was common for governments to do&nbsp;<a href="https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Tax+Farming">tax farming</a>, which effectively meant that it sold the right to impose a certain tax for a set period of time.</p>
    <p>Suppose the government sold off the right to collect the estate tax for the next two decades for $1 trillion. The deficit hawks could all be very happy because our debt would now be $1 trillion lower, but anyone capable of logical thought would see that this has not relieved the burden of the debt on our children one iota.</p>
    <p>It is the same story with patent rents.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>And it's not just patents and copyrights.</p>
   <p>The state could in principle operate a comprehensive and vigorous antitrust regime. In practice, the state purposefully tolerates varying degrees of consolidation in many industries. Why?</p>
   <p>Corruption? Capture? Of course that's part of it.</p>
   <p>But there is also the true fact, which policymakers do understand, that insisting on Econ-101-style "perfect competition" for high-fixed-cost industries can be a prescription for not having those industries at all. The pricing power regulators tolerate, the consolidation they even <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1997-book2/html/PPP-1997-book2-doc-pg993.htm">encourage</a>, amounts to a state-granted license to impose an excise tax on consumers, just like patents.</p>
   <p>Just like patents, this might be a good thing. If our counterfactual will be perfect competition, foreseeable failure to recoup costs might prevent these industries from existing at all. But just like patents, we have a hard time evaluating whether this taxing power that we are so tacitly and indirectly granting is too little, leaving valuable activity underfinanced, or too much, and then a license for predation and extraction.</p>
   <p>Patents, copyrights, and tolerated market power are all means of subsidizing activities that could not thrive or even survive under Econ-101 perfect competition. But the function of competition is not only low prices. We want firms to vigorously compete because competition drives quality and innovation.</p>
   <p>High fixed-cost, low-variable-cost industries require some form of subsidy to survive. Both in the West and in <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">China</a>, governments have hit upon politically convenient, off-balance-sheet forms of subsidy. When the government is going to give somebody a sweetheart deal, it is preferable, from the perspective both of government officials and of recipients, if those sweetheart deals are hidden, deniable, <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo12244559.html">submerged</a>. This might not, however, be preferable from the perspective of the general public. And it damages our forward-looking capacity for policymaking, because we end up underestimating the costs of current practices when we evaluate "expensive" proposed reforms.</p>
   <p>China's tacit subsidies take the form of badly underpriced loans, which state-backed banks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_financing_vehicle">local government financing vehicles</a> pretend are good long after they are not, as well as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426621001230">government-directed venture capital</a>. Subsidy gets smuggled through losses that nobody will recognize for a long time. This form of tacit subsidy has advantages over Western practices of tolerating insulation from competition and granting limited monopolies. The Chinese approach preserves the non-price benefits of competition. Chinese firms face ruthless competition for share in vigorously contested industries. They compete on quality, and they compete to innovate, even though before long they are all basically price-takers. China finances its industry contestants like it finances its Olympic contestants. The state pays up to cover the costs of bringing them into the arena.</p>
   <p>In the West we subsidize too, but the <em>form</em> of our subsidy deprives our industries of the benefit of truly vigorous competition. Our firms become complacent, less innovative, less careful to insure the very highest product quality.</p>
   <p>I don't propose that we adopt China's approach to subsidizing high-fixed-cost, low-variable-cost industries. China's cautious and opaque political system can work out its bad loans, with quiet bailouts to keep banks and local governments above water, with discretionary "corruption" prosecutions to ensure local officials compete not to be the lossiest among a cohort of investments that should be expected, on average, to make losses. If we tried China's approach in the West, we would have massive scandals over every failed loan and bitter fights about the injustice of the bailouts.</p>
   <p>What I do propose is that we in the West acknowledge that our great industries are in fact subsidized, that they are not and they cannot be pure "free market" success stories. We should work consciously, intentionally, to develop new <em>forms of subsidy</em> consistent both with much more vigorous competition and our more transparent political life.</p>
   <p>We should move away from grants of monopoly power, whether tacit acceptance of consolidation or overt patents and copyrights. Those tools do important work, but they have terrible side effects. We can do better.</p>

   <p>Price regulation is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-price-gouging-ban-inflation-65dc8844bb41159d76886f752b6cab28">in the ether</a>. I find the "debate", such as it is, stupid. Some forms of price regulation, under some circumstances, can be <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9416.html">helpful</a> or even <a href="https://jwmason.org/slackwire/in-praise-of-profiteering/">necessary</a>. Badly crafted or misapplied price regulation can indeed lead to gluts, shortage, mangled incentives, and destructive allocations. It really does depend.</p>
   <p>If you already know whether you like a "ban on price gouging" without having seen the details of the proposal, you are just an ideologue, one way or the other. If you hold yourself out as an economist and you are taking a strong position on the proposal at its current level of unspecificity, might I recommend my recent piece on <a href="2024/06/09/authority-minimization/index.html">authority minimization</a>?</p>
   <p>Rather than get ahead of ourselves, let's discuss a form of price reform that is occurring already, without any impetus from the state. <em>The American Prospect</em> recently did a <a href="https://prospect.org/pricing">full, remarkable issue</a> on pricing, emphasizing price discrimination or "personalized pricing".</p>
   <p>I find it a bit counterintuitive that it's my friends at <em>The American Prospect</em> who get upset about this, rather than my friends at George Mason University. (With genuine affection, I consider GMU Economics to be the lightbearer for Hayekian economics, now that the man himself has left us.)</p>
   <p>A common apology for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-are-different-types-price-discrimination-and-how-are-they-used.asp">first degree price discrimination</a> is that it's "efficient". And it is, in one narrow sense. Let's review the Econ-101-style diagrams below (modified from an <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5117.html">old piece</a>):</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="2024/08/18/murdering-hayek/murdering-hayek-pricing-diagrams.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="2024/08/18/murdering-hayek/murdering-hayek-pricing-diagrams.png"></a></p>
   <p>The upper-left-hand diagram shows the Marshallian equilibrium that we ordinarily imagine as efficient. When the price — there is just one price, the same public price for everyone — has <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tatonnement">groped</a> to where the supply and demand curves meet, both the quantity exchanged and total surplus is maximized.</p>
   <p>The bottom row shows two pathological cases. If the price is prevented from finding the equilibrium price — whether by private market power or by public regulation — there is "deadweight loss" (the red triangles). Total surplus is reduced.</p>
   <p>Surplus is a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5149.html">problematic measure</a> of welfare, but Econ 101 courses disgracefully treat the two as interchangeable, so the smarty-pants pundit class does the same. Under this analysis, price-setting, whether by states or by monopolies, makes the collective "us" <em>prima facie</em> worse off.</p>
   <p>The diagram on the upper right depicts "perfect" or "first degree" price discrimination. That's when sellers know precisely the maximum amount each potential customer would be willing to pay for an item, and charges precisely that. No real-life seller can know preferences so perfectly, but digital tools now surveil, study, cluster, and predict our behavior pretty well. In an app, on a website, even <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/17/nx-s1-5009271/electronic-shelf-labels-prices-walmart-grocery-store">in a grocery store</a>, pricing can increasingly be tailored to us.</p>
   <p>Notice that in this diagram there are no scary red triangles, there is no deadweight loss. The quantity exchanged and the total surplus are the same as at the Marshallian equilibrium. So first-degree price discrimination is "efficient".</p>
   <p>The difference from the competitive equilibrium (upper-left) is only distributional: In the single-price, Marshallian case, consumers and producers split the surplus. In the price-discrimination case, producers enjoy all the surplus, and consumers enjoy none. The purchases are "worth it" to buyers, but just. Whatever consumers have bought is worth barely more to them than the dollars they have spent. Sellers, on the other hand, receive a lot more money than it cost to market the good.</p>
   <p>To a certain kind of economist, distribution doesn't matter, or is a second-order concern. That is far from my own view. People "on the left" tend to dislike price discrimination, because producer surplus (business profit) goes disproportionately to the already wealthy, while consumer surplus would have been more broadly distributed.</p>
   <p>If you are Hayekian, you should have a different but equally fatal concern.</p>
   <p>From Hayek's <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html"><em>The Use of Knowledge in Society</em></a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place... [T]he ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them... But the “man on the spot” cannot decide solely on the basis of his limited but intimate knowledge of the facts of his immediate surroundings. There still remains the problem of communicating to him such further information as he needs to fit his decisions into the whole pattern of changes of the larger economic system...</p>
    <p>[T]his problem can be solved, and in fact is being solved, by the price system...</p>
    <p>[I]n a system in which the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed among many people, prices can act to coördinate the separate actions of different people in the same way as subjective values help the individual to coördinate the parts of his plan. It is worth contemplating for a moment a very simple and commonplace instance of the action of the price system to see what precisely it accomplishes. Assume that somewhere in the world a new opportunity for the use of some raw material, say, tin, has arisen, or that one of the sources of supply of tin has been eliminated. It does not matter for our purpose — and it is very significant that it does not matter — which of these two causes has made tin more scarce. All that the users of tin need to know is that some of the tin they used to consume is now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in consequence, they must economize tin... <strong>The mere fact that there is one price for any commodity — or rather that local prices are connected in a manner determined by the cost of transport, etc. — brings about the solution which (it is just conceptually possible) might have been arrived at by one single mind possessing all the information which is in fact dispersed among all the people involved in the process.</strong></p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
   <p>Let's consider a concrete case. I need a new roof, which could be made of tin or plastic. I prefer tin. I'd be willing to pay up to $9000 for a tin roof and $5000 for a plastic roof. A price discriminating monopolist offers me precisely those prices. Which I choose is then a flip of the coin. I've been deprived of information that might distinguish them. At these prices, I'm indifferent between the two options, or even to not buying at all.</p>
   <p>Suppose that under a competitive single-price equilibrium, the tin roof would have cost $6000, and the plastic roof would have cost $1000. Because tin is dear relative to my own knowledge of my preferences (my surplus for tin would be $3000, for plastic $4000), I would have economized and purchased plastic, contributing to an efficient allocation. But under perfect price discrimination, my contribution to the as-if "single mind possessing all the information" is reduced to noise, a fifty-fifty coin flip.</p>
   <p><em>Ah!</em> you say, <em>But the price discriminating seller wouldn't behave this way!</em> Megacorp would know the "true" prices of underlying commodities, and would profit more from offering the plastic roof for $4900. At this price, I reliably choose plastic, the seller makes $3900 rather than the mere $3000 it would have made from tin, and tin is economized as it would be in a competitive market.</p>
   <p>But then what you are saying is Megacorp's knowledge is sufficient to completely cut me out of the information aggregation process with no loss. My local information has no role to play. Megacorp knows me well enough to prejudge me and perform my role.</p>
   <p>And maybe so! I don't know very much.</p>
   <p>But it's turtles all the way down. If cartel and price discrimination are normalized, then Megacorp's vendors are also predicting what Megacorp will pay, and providing prices that maximize its own profits rather than reflect underlying social costs. Megacorp is also cut out of any role in the information problem. The system ultimately works — correctly solves the market optimization problem — only if there is some foundational set of vendors, a cartel for whom Hayek's "dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge" have been surveilled and aggregated and reconciled after all.</p>
   <p>Long ago I <a href="https://x.com/interfluidity/status/908391949350051840">tweeted</a></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>path to socialism: Amazon solves economic calculation problem and swallows the whole economy. then we nationalize it.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>If you think an economy in which price discrimination is normalized can be efficient, then you think Hayek's work is obsolete. The cartel that price discriminates constitutes a capable central planner. If we will have a capable central planner, most of us would have it under the control of an imperfectly democratic state, rather than operate as a maximizer of private shareholders' wealth.</p>
   <p>I do not in fact think Hayek is obsolete. Neither Amazon nor ChatGPT can incorporate the ever-changing, infintely dispersed knowledge that drove Hayek's vision.</p>
   <p>But if Hayek is not obsolete, if we move towards "personalized pricing", firms will routinely price discriminate but misjudge. On the one hand, that means at least sometimes consumers will still enjoy surplus. Hooray!</p>
   <p>At the systemic level, however, it means our optimizer will be badly broken, and we will all be made the poorer. Megacorp will think I'd be willing to pay $6000 for a plastic roof, and so offer it to me for $5900. But for that price, I prefer the tin. A social resource will have been diverted from a high-value to a low-value use, because our price-discriminating planner erred. Multiply this kind of mistake countless times, and Hayek's “economic calculus” goes haywire. We will have destroyed the very purpose and function of markets in our economy.</p>
   <p>Either price discrimination can be perfected, and we should move to a centrally planned economy. Or it cannot be, Hayek remains right, and we should insist on competitive markets with single public prices. Which is it?</p>
   <p>"I have deliberately used the word 'marvel' to shock the reader out of the complacency with which we often take the working of this mechanism for granted," Hayek <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html">writes</a> of the price system.</p>
   <p>I find it astonishing how untroubled Hayek's successors now seem by developments that could only be wise if Hayek's marvel has become a museum piece.</p>
   <p>Maybe AI really will do a better job of allocating scarce resources than markets and the price system used to. Maybe it really is time to move on.</p>
   <p>But you'd think Hayekians would be evaluating that claim skeptically, rather than cheerleading the change.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Zongyuan Zoe Liu has <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-real-economic-crisis">a piece in <em>Foreign Affairs</em></a> on the contemporary Chinese economy (ht <a href="https://x.com/michaelxpettis/status/1821777692275953789">Michael Pettis</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Brad_Setser/status/1821632733094785513">Brad Setser</a>). As description, the piece is excellent. As prescription, well, I take the other side.</p>
   <p>The financial and economic model that China stumbled into — as Liu points out, as early as 1980, under Deng Xiaoping — is far from perfect. It was an improvisation, not a designed thing. Its pieces don't quite fit together. Inconsistencies must be put off and papered over. Financial arrangements have emerged that obscure and render stable contradictions rather than address or resolve them. Perhaps that is a talent China has <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/548.html">learned from us</a>.</p>
   <p>Yet as we survey the past forty years, we should ask a simple question and answer it honestly. Which model has been more successful, mainstream Western economics or China's improvised heterodoxy?</p>
   <p>I think China wins. It certainly wins in terms of national development and "national greatness". I think it also has done a better job of improving citizen welfare.</p>
   <p>In the past you could argue that China's model was fine for catapulting a poor, backwards economy towards the "technological frontier", but that economies already at the frontier require the considered rationality only Western economics can offer. However, China is no longer a poor, backwards economy. Yes, in income-per-capita terms, China remains a developing country. But it boasts a middle class that enjoys developed-world living standards and is larger than most developed countries. In many respects, China <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/06/12/china-has-become-a-scientific-superpower">now defines</a> the technological frontier.</p>
   <p>The transit writer <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/">Alon Levy</a> often <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2024/08/07/more-on-american-incuriosity-new-york-regional-rail-edition-part-1-european-history/">remarks</a> of the United States that it fails to accomplish things that are common and easy everywhere else, because Americans simply refuse to accept they have something to learn. I think the West writ large makes the same mistake with respect to China.</p>
   <p>To be very clear, I do not embrace China's political model. I believe China's economic model can be adapted to Western democracy. In fact, I think the model would be much improved by a more intentional implementation, designed for rule under less discretionary law. Subsidy that China provides through <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">informal encouragement of politically sensitive banks</a> could be provided via overt government programs. <a href="2023/03/26/banks-should-fail-much-more-often/index.html">Mechanisms of accountability</a> can be developed and agreed to <em>ex ante</em>, rather than applied <em>ad hoc</em>, <em>ex post</em>, when forbearance can no longer be sustained on bad loans that serve as fig-leaves for subsidy.</p>
   <h3><a href="#liu-vs-polanyi" id="liu-vs-polanyi" name="liu-vs-polanyi" class="anchorlink"></a>Liu vs Polanyi</h3>
   <p>I loved this zinger from the Liu article:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>In the West, money influences politics, but in China it is the opposite: politics influences money.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>The implication is that this is a problem. Liu writes from an orthodox Western economic perspective, under which there are free markets whose basic nature is to optimize and yield efficient outcomes, but which politics might "distort".</p>
   <p>When I read the quip, however, I think of Karl Polanyi's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)"><em>Great Transformation</em></a>, and the necessity of embedding of economic life in social relations. Democratic politics <em>should</em> influence the sphere of money, exchange, and production, which is only a means to the end of general welfare. China's putative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole-process_people%27s_democracy">"whole-process people's democracy"</a> is not my democratic ideal. But it is more democratic than the plutocracy that emerges (but proves unstable) when economic liberalism is allowed to run unchecked. From Polanyi's perspective, and mine, of course "politics influences money". It should. The question is how.</p>
   <h3><a href="#thick-antitrust" id="thick-antitrust" name="thick-antitrust" class="anchorlink"></a>Thick antitrust</h3>
   <p>Very often, what Liu describes as a deficiency of the Chinese model, I would describe as an advantage:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>A larger problem with China’s reliance on local government to implement industrial policy is that it causes cities and regions across the country to compete in the same sectors rather than complement each other or play to their own strengths. Thus, for more than two decades, Chinese provinces—from Xinjiang in the west to Shanghai in the east, from Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan in the south—have, with very little coordination between them, established factories in the same government-designated priority industries, driven by provincial and local officials’ efforts to outperform their peers. Inevitably, this domestic competition has led to overcapacity and high levels of debt, even in industries in which China has gained global market dominance...</p>
    <p>Whenever the Chinese government prioritizes a new sector, duplicative investments by local governments inevitably fuel intense domestic competition.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Vigorous competition is what distinguishes a virtuous market economy from a predatory racket. In the United States, we rely upon regulation and litigation by antitrust authorities to ensure that markets remain open and competitive.</p>
   <p>But that is a fragile solution. In the best of times — which is now, thank you Lina Khan, Jonathan Kanter, Joe Biden — scarce enforcement resources must be devoted to an eternal game of Whac-A-Mole.</p>
   <p>Times are not usually the best of times, alas. The core talent of <em>Homo sapiens</em> is to coordinate in mutual interest. As Adam Smith famously <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/adam-smith/the-wealth-of-nations/text/single-page">wrote</a></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>When nascent concentrations of wealth can be laundered into influence, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1258156478.shtml">political economy renders regulation less and less zealous</a>. Eventually some crisis — political, economic, or financial — reawakens dormant vigilence. But only after a great deal of damage is done.</p>
   <p>A <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/197.html">perennial</a> <a href="2023/02/24/thick-antitrust/index.html">theme</a> of this blog is that we should prefer structural rather than supervisory solutions to regulatory problems.</p>
   <p>I doubt it was predicted or designed, but when the practice emerged of delegating industrial policy to local governments, China invented a structural form of antitrust. The central state declares what industries are to be favored, and then many localities toss contenders into the ring. The unsurprising result is competition. At the national level, with astonishing speed, industries with world-class competences emerge, even when — especially when — no "national champion" comes to dominate.</p>
   <p>Great industries are what a nation wants, not great firms. Firms are just the players. They perform extraordinary feats, and we cheer them, but they come and go. The industry is the league. It is what endures and delivers decade after decade.</p>
   <p>A decade ago China did not produce electric vehicles. Now <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/">it is the world leader</a>. It is the same story with batteries, solar panels, steel.</p>
   <p>In the US, we tend to provide government support to established national champions, <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/14/seeing-like-a-ceo/index.html">Boeing</a> perhaps, or <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/10/leadership-lessons-intel-apple-wrong-ceos-corporate-decline/">Intel</a>. How is that working for us? Large consolidated firms <a href="2024/04/11/indirection-and-the-character-of-capitalism-part-ii/index.html">become specialists</a> in exploiting market power and political influence rather than any technical facet of production. What if we financed state governments to field local heroes and compete in the big leagues?</p>
   <p>It boggles the American imagination to think that medium-sized, US-state-level enterprises could compete in high-tech, capital-intensive industries. But isn't China's experience an existence proof? Shouldn't the share-buyback-heavy, technical-achievement-light experience of firms like Boeing and Intel chasten our conventional wisdom?</p>
   <p>If we were to try to replicate China's model, there are also negative lessons we should learn from China. Rather than let ongoing state support derive from losses that go unrecognized on bank balance sheets — or that accumulate, Enron-style, in special-purpose vehicles that might have names like "Dorian Gray Selfie" — we should invent arrangements that offer continuing rates of subsidy to our contenders on preagreed terms.</p>
   <h3><a href="#overcapacity" id="overcapacity" name="overcapacity" class="anchorlink"></a>Overcapacity</h3>
   <p>The scourge of Liu's piece is "overcapacity". I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/166.html">first wrote</a> to address panics over Chinese overcapacity in 2008. Despite unceasing handwringing by Western economists, I think China has done pretty well over the last 16 years. What economists call "overcapacity" is usually a distributional problem.</p>
   <p>Again, I think we are running up against a flaw in orthodox economic thinking. In theory, the market is an optimizer. If you are willing to make lots of assumptions (perfect information, perfect competition, a "correct" distribution of initial endowments among consumers, only variable, marginally-increasing costs in production, etc.), you can tell a story under which there is one socially optimal level of production for each good and service. At that nirvana, all firms enjoy precisely zero economic profit.</p>
   <p>Under this theory, whose teleological purpose is a unique optimum, overcapacity is a real thing. At the optimum, all resources are employed. Deviating by producing too much of one thing requires producing too little of something else, or else investing too little in future production. One symptom of overcapacity in this theory would be firms operating at an economic loss, or equivalently, requiring a subsidy to break even.</p>
   <p>This brings us again to the flawed intuition that our task is to protect a putative optimum from distortion. State subsidy "distorts" economic activity from its one true optimality by provoking and permitting overcapacity.</p>
   <p>But the only way there could be a general overcapacity, as opposed to overcapacity of some particular good or service, would be if there were an inadequate level of investment for the future. No one can credibly accuse China of that. So the issue becomes China's "strategic" goods and services — solar panels, electric vehicles, batteries — are overproduced relative to, say, consumer goods and services that might be produced if subsidies to strategic industries disappeared and household incomes were higher.</p>
   <p>Western economists who are often shy about addressing distributional issues in our own economies have a very strong view that ordinary househods should have more purchasing power and Xi Jinping should have less. Maybe so!</p>
   <p>But let's consider a model with three classes of purchaser: Ordinary households, Xi Jinping, and Marc Andreeson. There is the economy that would have prevailed if only ordinary households had puchasing power, in roughly equal amounts. There is the economy that prevails when a very large pool of purchasing power is directed by Xi Jinping. Xi uses this purchasing power to produce a lot more steel, batteries, EVs, solar panels, on the theory that strategic, rather than demand-driven investment in those sectors will leave his nation-state better positioned for the future. No doubt, the resulting is an economy "distorted" relative to an entirely demand-driven economy.</p>
   <p>Now let's transfer the purchasing power under Xi's direction to Andreeson. (I'm using poor Marc here as a stand-in for the venture capital industry. I'm not making specific claims about the man.) Marc does not invest so much in steel, solar, or EVs, because he knows there will be inadequate demand for those goods to recoup Xi-scale investments. Where Xi subsidizes loss-making solar panel companies, Andreeson subsidizes loss-making Ubers, DoorDashes, etc. on the theory that he can eventually recoup those losses by scaling fastest in what will become winner-take-all markets, and earning thick profits thereafter. This economy also is "distorted" relative to an economy driven only by meeting demand from hypothetical approximately equal households. It is warped beyond recognition relative to the optimum under any model in which perfect competition would obtain.</p>
   <p>Western economists applaud Andreeson's economy, but disparage Xi's. I think that is madness.</p>
   <p>Perhaps China devotes too much of its resources to strategic investment and should leave more in the hands of consumers to enjoy. But the quality of strategic investment in China is much higher than in Western economies, in large part because China structures its investments so that they finance bitterly competitive industries, while profit-motivated Western investors quite openly seek "moats" to support margins that should not even exist under the hypothetical optimality that economists must presume guides production, if they are going to make claims about "overcapacity" driven by state subsidy.</p>
   <h3><a href="#sclerosis" id="sclerosis" name="sclerosis" class="anchorlink"></a>Sclerosis</h3>
   <p>Instead of asking how we can achieve optimality against the risk of distortion, it is more constructive to ask how we can achieve capabilty against the risk of sclerosis.</p>
   <p>In our fallen world, there is no such thing as optimal. When toy models are grafted onto real circumstances to advance some claim of optimality, you are being snowed.</p>
   <p>In real life, we never have the choice not to err. We will err. A choice we often do have is in which direction to err. We cannot, in any industry, discover the true, correct amount that should be produced. We can create circumstances under which we are likely to err by producing too much, or to err by producing to little.</p>
   <p>Overcapacity implies capacity. If we err by producing too little, we may not develop the know-how, the process knowledge, to be capable of producing at all. (See <a href="https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/">Dan Wang</a>.) We know there are positive externalities to manufacturing, and developing ecosystems that support it. So in perfectly orthodox economic terms, manufacturing, at least in strategic industries, should be subsidized. In fact, if we are only producing at the market-optimal level — if, before any subsidy, firms in competitive industries are not, on average, loss-making — then we are underproducing. Once we conjure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigouvian_tax">Arthur Pigou</a>, China's "zombie" firms look more like optimality rather than distortion!</p>
   <p>Overcapacity has social option value. You may not need all the capacity you build. After the fact, much of the capacity may be naively condemned as waste. But the future is uncertain. Terms of trade might shift. Exigencies like a pandemic might dramatically increase demand for previously obscure goods. It is often wise to pay hard cash for out-of-the-money options, even though those options may never be exercised.</p>
   <p>Industrial capacity has insurance value. Those fire insurance premiums you paid were not a rip-off, just because the house never burned. In important industries, if we are not developing at scales that would, under vigorus competition, leave firms making losses absent subsidy, then we are not investing wisely.</p>
   <h3><a href="#beggar-thy-neighbor" id="beggar-thy-neighbor" name="beggar-thy-neighbor" class="anchorlink"></a>Beggar thy neighbor?</h3>
   <p>Perhaps China's economic model is good for China. But is it good for, fair to, everyone else? Could other countries adapt and adopt it, or is it based fundamentally on a kind of parasitism that cannot scale?</p>
   <p>From the Liu piece:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>In a speech in May, Lael Brainard, the director of the Biden administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, warned that China’s “policy-driven industrial overcapacity”—a euphemism for antimarket practices—was hurting the global economy. By enforcing policies that “unfairly depress capital, labor, and energy costs” and allow Chinese firms to sell “at or below cost,” she said, China now accounts for a huge percentage of global capacity in electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors, and other sectors. As a consequence, Beijing is hampering innovation and competition in the global marketplace, threatening jobs in the United States and elsewhere, and limiting the ability of the United States and other Western countries to build supply chain resilience.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>No offense to Brainard, but I think this kind of complaint is just pathetic. The United States and Europe are not small, weak, actors, helpless against Chinese economic imperialism. We are — and have been for much longer than China — rich, powerful, and capable. Let's take <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/71.html">some responsibility</a> for our own policy decisions.</p>
   <p>China stumbled into, then doubled down on, a set of policies that has served its people and its interests extraordinarily well, for decades. None of this is new. The terms of trade we offer China — with respect to goods and the investment vehicles that make possible China's surplus — have always been ours to choose. We can close our borders to any or all of China's industries if we want to and we are serious about it. That would be very painful for us now, but it has become so difficult only because we've made stupid mistakes for years.</p>
   <p>To be very clear, I think it would have been horrible if we had simply closed our borders to China in 1995, or if we fully closed our borders now. China's rise has been a miracle for human welfare. It did not have to also become a catastrophe for the United States. We could have, we absolutely should have, offered terms-of-trade that protected our interests while encouraging mutually beneficial exchange.</p>
   <p>It is not hard to devise mechanisms that would regulate our (multilateral) balance-of-trade. We can ensure our trade with the rest-of-the-world is balanced, or only as imbalanced as we choose. Warren Buffett offered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import_certificates">a proposal</a> in 2003. My preference (with e.g. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/29/capital-flow-united-states-economy-trade-deficit/">Michael Pettis</a>) is for "<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/540.html">capital account protectionism</a>". These are things we can do, and always could have done, that would have regulated trade without slamming doors our shut or discriminating against particular countries. They are things that we still should do.</p>
   <p>In the current era of geopolitical concern and heightened distrust, broad controls on the balance of trade will unfortunately not be sufficient. China invests in vast capacity across a whole range of strategic industries, because that's the right thing to do <em>for China</em>. It develops the country's capabilities, and works to expand its options, even under terrible contingencies like an abrupt decoupling from the West due to sanctions. The United States will need to do the same things, for the same reasons. Building capacity well beyond near-term domestic demand means the marginal cost of producing for export becomes very low. That's the case already for China. But the logic is portable.</p>
   <p>So yes, China will sell goods very cheaply into export markets, if destination countries are willing to let buyers buy. Whether they do is destination countries' choice. Some countries will consider an industry strategic. They will and should use tariffs or other means to protect domestic production. Other countries will let their consumers enjoy very cheap goods, when multiple powers build capacity and then compete to sell low-marginal-cost excess production abroad. The net effect will be a consumer subsidy from "strategic powers" (in any given industry) to the rest of the world.</p>
   <p>That's not a bad thing! That "rest of the world" will most of the time include most poorer countries. The developing world buys everything from China today. If the United States adopts China's model, then US-produced goods will become competitive with Chinese goods. Third-country markets will become the measure of relative quality, and hopefully serve to check more corrupt variants of protectionism. If, under a pretext of "strategic", the US protects an industry, not to develop know-how and capacity, but to enable US producers to fleece domestic consumers, we will know it, because American exports will not be competitive, on price and quality, in countries that permit the sale of both on equal terms.</p>
   <p>American goods, produced at American wages, can be competitive with Chinese goods in world markets! We are so mired in learned helplessness, the very possibility shocks our intuitions. But China's advantage in world trade no longer derives from low labor costs. China sells so cheaply because it has made itself so capable, in precisely the sense that the word "overcapacity" means to scold. If we, like China, find ways to develop overcapacity in our industries while maintaining vigorous competition among our firms, then our exports will be very cheap as well. The factories will already have been built. Churning out another one for overseas sale will be just the cost of inputs.</p>
   <p>But can China's model even work if other powers also adopt it? China has relied upon large trade surpluses. Suppose that Europe, China, India, and a trading block including North America and the United States' Pacific allies each adopt China's model.</p>
   <p>For industries that one power considers strategic but others do not, China's model can work just as it does now. For industries that multiple blocks consider strategic, any surplus could only emerge to the degree nonaligned powers prove willing to accept a trade deficit — and global (or perhaps less-than-global) capital markets prove willing to finance it. With bids from the largest export markets cut off, export prices and the profitiability of external sales would be lower than they have been. Overall, surpluses would be much smaller than what China has enjoyed.</p>
   <p>So does that kill the model? No. It just makes it more expensive. The profits that Chinese firms have taken from export sales would have to be replaced in large part by state subsidy. In accounting terms, as support from the foreign sector recedes, the government sector will have to step in to fill the gap. "Excess" capacity — and the know-how and option value it brings — will be more expensive in this brave new world than it has been thus far for China. Governments might choose to simply pay up for China-scale capacity. Or, at the higher price, they might choose to purchase somewhat less capacity, but enjoy less of the capability that comes bundled with it.</p>
   <p>Whether overtly or covertly, firms in strategic industries will require continuing subsidy. That's not waste. It's wisdom.</p>
   <h3><a href="#converge-on-which" id="converge-on-which" name="converge-on-which" class="anchorlink"></a>Converge on which?</h3>
   <p>Liu ends her piece giving advice precisely opposite to mine.</p>
   <p>Liu points out, correctly, that the US adopting China's approach — and therefore regaining some supply-chain independence from China — will only cause China to pursue initiatives like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025">Made in China 2025</a> even more urgently. A more decoupled world is a world in which war between these great powers — these wonderful coutries! — arguably becomes less unthinkable.</p>
   <p>Liu suggests that with negotiation, we could mutually find our way back to a liberal international trade system, except this time — this time! — China would abandon the development model that has served it so extraordinarily. China would cease laundering the state subsidy at that model's core through a trade system that ostensibly forbids it. The great powers would remain interwoven by commerce, intertwined in mutual dependence, making it more likely that our geopolitical disputes would be resolved peacefully.</p>
   <p>That's a movie we've seen before. It was the story of why World War I could never happen. World War I did happen. "Mutual dependence" is a gauzy, hopeful phrase. But when you drill down into it, you find heterogeneous networks of asymmetric dependencies and capabilities that can, as Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman famously point out, be <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/introducing-new-paper-weaponized-interdependence">weaponized</a>. When geopolitical disputes smolder, economic interdependence may not improve trust. It can become a battlefield, a site for low intensity conflict that increases risks of escalation to something much, much worse.</p>
   <p>I don't have a surefire prescription for peace. But I think great powers that are capable and secure are likely to be less prone to conflict than powers that feel like they are declining, or contained, or otherwise threatened. Housemates squabble. Good fences make good neighbors.</p>
   <p>Liu proposes that we negotiate to try to reconverge on the Western model of liberal trade and interdependence. That convergence was the hope and the project of the last few decades. It has failed, dangerously. It is certainly possible that we could try again, learn from our mistakes, make it work.</p>
   <p>My suggestion is that we work slowly, incrementally but intentionally, to converge upon China's economic model. Under mutual adoption, the model would change a bit. Excess capacity would become more costly, due to less help from a foreign surplus. But the core of the model would remain sound. In a nutshell...</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>Excess capacity is better than scarce capacity, for its option value and for the externalities in process knowledge and generalized capability that derive from manufacturing. Err on the side of overcapacity.</p></li>
    <li>
     <p>The positive externalities of capacity merit subsidy. Subsidize.</p></li>
    <li>
     <p>Vouchsafe competition by constraining the structure of industries in how you structure the subsidies. Don't rely solely on regulatory supervision and enforcement, which risks an endless cat-and-mouse game against "innovators" in cartel and consolidation.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Domestically, China's model has simply outperformed the 19th Century economic model that we keep falling back to. Internationally, I think converging on the China model would better serve the cause of peace.</p>
   <p>If you haven't read <a href="https://jmaynardkeynes.ucc.ie/national-self-sufficiency.html">Keynes' speech on national self-sufficiency</a>, I don't know why you are wasting time on my drivel. 1933 was a time not so unlike our own. Unfortunately.</p>
   <p>I'll let the gentleman have the last word:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>We are pacifist to-day with so much strength of conviction that, if the economic internationalist could win this point, he would soon recapture our support. But it does not to-day seem obvious that a great concentration of national effort on the capture of foreign trade, that the penetration of a country's economic structure by the resources and the influence of foreign capitalists, that a close dependence of our own economic life on the fluctuating economic policies of foreign countries are safeguards and assurances of international peace. It is easier, in the light of experience and foresight, to argue quite the contrary...</p>
    <p>Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel these are the things which should of their nature be international. But let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national. Yet, at the same time, those who seek to disembarrass a country of its entanglements should be very slow and wary. It should not be a matter of tearing up roots but of slowly training a plant to grow in a different direction. For these strong reasons, therefore, I am inclined to the belief that, after the transition is accomplished, a greater measure of national self-sufficiency and economic isolation between countries, than existed in 1914, may tend to serve the cause of peace rather than otherwise.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>Sixteen years ago, I was amped for the election of Barack Obama. I was all-in.</p>
   <p>To say that I was disappointed by Obama's presidency is an <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/11/30/obama-was-the-most-destructive-political-figure-of-my-lifetime/index.html">understatement</a>. I think Barack Obama broke my country. We are not red states or blue states but the United States of America, he famously loved to say. We are one country, undivided.</p>
   <p>But what he proved by his administration's choices is that there are creditors whom the law protects but does not bind, and there are debtors whom the law binds but does not protect. Barack Obama's oratory was soaring, inspiring, progressive. But his governance was the <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288">very definition</a> of conservative. There was just nothing and nobody left to trust.</p>
   <p>When "even the liberals" follow Wilhoit's Law, the only thing left to fight over is who's the in-group. Donald Trump perceived that, and we've been fighting it out ever since.</p>
   <p>Today I find that I am all-in for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. And I am terrified.</p>
   <p>Like a true-believing Calvinist fearful his predestiny might not be among the elect, I find myself trawling for signs, signs, signs. Will Harris continue the Biden-Harris administration's excellent start at reigning in corporate power, supporting labor, challenging plutocracy, building a nation that prospers not because "merit" is excusive, but because there is a successful place for all of us? Will Harris support the version of "free enterprise" that I support, under which the least of us, with grit and a good idea, can compete to offer wonders to our neighbors, and prosper from the good we do for others, without being bought-out or or rolled-up or crushed by monied interests? Or will she take "free enterprise" to mean what the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce mean — that big business must be left to do what it wants, regardless of how extractive or predatory their actions "superficially" appear to be, because the market knows our interest better than we do, even as we are foreclosed, evicted, outsourced, overcharged, and penalized?</p>
   <p>No matter how devout is our dear Calvinist, God does not actually reveal in signs who is among the elect, or who is damned.</p>
   <p>I can find hopeful signs, like Harris' choice of Tim Walz as running mate. I can find awful signs, like <a href="https://x.com/EugenePuryear/status/1821347244655640811">this from Maryland governor Wes Moore</a>. Matt Stoller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/opinion/kamala-harris-google-antitrust.html">reads entrails</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
   <p>But there were no reliable signs that Joe Biden — the Senator from MBNA, a man whose approach to bankruptcy law had previously been the white-shoe version of loan-shark kneecapping — would govern as heir to LBJ and FDR. The fact is we cannot know.</p>
   <p>"Surrogate" Wes Moore can go on CNBC and paint a picture of Kamala Harris that inspires in CEOs the same emotion Taylor Swift conjures in a middle-school field hockey team. And that's fine. That's what he should do, if his goal is to help Harris win. Whatever a "surrogate" says, Harris herself has not made any promises.</p>
   <p>We might prefer a version of democracy in which candidates make clear statements about how they would govern, and the public makes an informed choice among those alternatives.</p>
   <p>That would require a very different political system.</p>
   <p>Our actual system requires a candidate for the Presidency to win roughly 50% of votes cast. Yet no candidate, under a glare of full transparency, with (implausible) complete foresight about how they would govern, could avoid alienating more than 50% of the electorate on at least one of the dozens of issues people care about.</p>
   <p>Candidates run on vibes and empty platitudes as much as they can for the same reason network television was bad in the 1980s — not because it is what "the public" actually wants, but because the less real substance attaches to a thing, the greater the share of a diverse and fractious population that can tolerate it. The trick is to entertain (on television) or to inspire (in politics) without actually touching on anything that might piss somebody off.</p>
   <p>When it is more important to please everybody just a little than to please anybody all that much, what you offer is sweet nothings. Or, if you go negative, condemnations of vague categories not so many people identify with — "extremist", "leftist", "elite", "MAGA", "illegal".</p>
   <p>We know where Kamala Harris stands on abortion rights, because restoring Roe is very broadly popular. We know where Donald Trump stands on immigration, because tighter restriction is very broadly popular.</p>
   <p>When Project 2025 seemed to tell us, in extraordinary and exhaustive detail, what Donald Trump might do, it revealed a lot that might not be so broadly popular. Trump promptly disavowed it. We really can know very little about what these people will actually do. When we know too much, it is because they have made a mistake.</p>
   <p>We do know Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVjraH4Ydxw">stands with unions</a>. She has made strong public promises. That's a big fucking deal! Unions are a wedge issue within a Democratic coalition that still includes a big-business donor class and the Clintonian technocrats who several decades ago worked to seal the coffin on the labor movement in order to appease Alan Greenspan.</p>
   <p>So why do we know Kamala Harris stands with unions? Because, thank goodness, the most important battleground states are Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where unions are strong and very broadly popular.</p>
   <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html">remarkable work</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp_6fvf3Lzw">Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter</a> is a bit more arcane. It derives from a broad, populist demand to reign in buttfuckery and abuse we all experience from businesses we detest but cannot escape. But antitrust litigation is less participatory, less accessible, than a strike at the plant. There's no mass constituency in Pennsylvania whose vote will depend on <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/">Matt Stoller's</a> endorsement. Public promises are unlikely to be made by the campaign. A new administration could sell us out. Absolutely.</p>
   <p>But we are not the only ones a new administration might sell out. Sometimes there is no way to know who is the diner and who is the food until the meal commences.</p>
   <p>A Calvinist cannot know whether he is predestined for salvation or damnation. The best he can do is to perform good works, to live a life consistent with election. Standing around and bargaining with God, looking for signs and objecting to bad ones, is perhaps not a life best lived.</p>
   <p>The <a href="2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">United States Supreme Court notwithstanding</a>, the US President is not God. And nothing in our politics is predestined. But a life well-lived still demands a leap of faith.</p>
   <p>I'm all-in for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. We can support the campaign, while we cheerfully express the values that are guiding us as we do. I believe the United States' economy will require, over time, a pretty wholesale restructuring — so that business is a level playing field any of us can contest, so that workers have great choices employers compete to sweeten, so that the most successful among us get rich enough to live lives of enviable luxury, but never so rich they are ever more than one person with one vote in the governance of our affairs.</p>

 <div class="entry-body">
  <div class="flexmark markdown">
   <p>We are so accustomed to being betrayed.</p>
   <p>Throughout the Clinton years, and especially the Obama years, we thought we were voting for Franklin Roosevelt’s party. Instead we found ourselves governed by parodies of Ronald Reagan, except garishly prouder of their fancier degrees. The arc of history bent toward every sort of justice except economic justice.</p>
   <p>Joe Biden, to his magnificent credit, strived, even if he did not always succeed, to govern in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt. But his term and his time are ending.</p>
   <p>So we are naked again. Of course, next year we might just be governed by fascists. We must do all we possibly can to prevent that. But does that mean we must struggle to elect another cadre of arrogant professionals who will <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4792753-gavin-newsom-executive-homeless-encampments-supreme-court-ruling/">clear us from their streets when we have nowhere to go</a>, even while they righteously rail against the Supreme Court justices who grant them the tools to do so?</p>
   <p>Only if we make that a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
   <p>A lot of angst has gone into reading tea leaves about who Kamala Harris <em>really</em> is. She has friends and colleagues among the corporate elite! When as Vice President she liaised with wealthy businessmen and courted their support, the poor dears lamented the burden of sitting on the other side of Lina Khan’s FTC. Harris duly sympathized.</p>
   <p>Kamala Harris is not a cipher. She is a professional politician. Like all of us, she is a human being with her own passions and principles. At some margin, at some critical moments, those passions and principles may hold sway. But as a professional politician, her work is to build a coalition to get elected, then, once elected, to staff and manage a government that sustains and expands the coalition.</p>
   <p>In a primary process or multiparty election, much of our job would be to suss out various candidate’s predilections, all those passions and principles, and choose which person or party’s values would be most likely to align with our own.</p>
   <p>We are not in a primary process or multiparty election.</p>
   <p>If you are a person who believes that a second Trump term — now with a <a href="2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">roadmap to Executive impunity</a> from an illegitimate Supreme Court — would be too dangerous to countenance, then you are going to vote for Kamala Harris.</p>
   <p>So. Just like under Obama, they’ll take us for granted. We’ll just have to <em>fall in line</em>, right?</p>
   <p>No.</p>
   <p>Our job now is to engage in a different kind of politics. A professional politician will dance with the ones that brung ‘em. It’s our job now to be the ones that bring Kamala Harris.</p>
   <p>If Lina-Khan-hating “liberal” corporate lawyers are Harris’ pillars of support, and by those weak pillars she still ekes out a victory over Donald Trump, well, then she might well govern as Obama 2.0 (and render inevitable a Trump 2.0). If Harris perceives her victories as happening despite us — the Bernie-ites, the Warren-ites, the social democrats — then she will do her best to ignore us while she placates her real constituents.</p>
   <p>But if she perceives her victories as happening <em>because</em> of us, then she will work for us and lead our movement.</p>
   <p>As part of that, we will have to rely upon our surrogates to work in private on our behalf. Now is not the time to extract promises in public that might be electorally counterproductive. AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren have access to the candidate. Although it goes against the grain of some naive conceptualizations of democracy, real negotiations happen in private. Sometimes the best that we can do is follow the lead of the people in the room whom we trust.</p>
   <p>There is no point now in grousing or debating like we are contesting a fantasy primary. Kamala Harris has already won. She is the champion we have.</p>
   <p>The work now isn’t for her to win us. It is for us to win her.</p>
