    <p>Suppose, <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/findings">completely hypothetically</a>, you ran a small RCT on UBI. (ht <a href="https://x.com/morganwarstler/status/1815479501427712049">Morgan Warstler</a>)</p>
    <p>Then there would be no meaningful</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>increase in labor demand (as a policy choice, or potentially as a direct effect of the UBI if demand is unmanaged) [to] restore[] the original quantity of work provided, but at significantly higher wages.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(Fourth slide above.)</p>
    <p>So what you would expect is to be stuck at the second diagram reproduced above. You would see a some reduction of the quantity of labor supplied, rather than the desired effect of an unchanged quantity of labor supplied, but at somewhat higher wages (the third diagram).</p>
    <p>To the degree that a basic income <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/findings/entrepreneurship">increases</a> <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5066.html">entrepreneurial intentions</a>, that might also, by a completely separate mechanism, yield an immediate-term reduction in employment and income, while recipients reduce labor force participation to devote time to enterprises not yet paying off.</p>
    <p>Hypothetically speaking, a two percentage point difference in employment and 1.3 hour per week average reduction in work hours — with both effects often indistinguishable within a 90% confidence interval, probably always indistinguishable within a more conventional 95% confidence interval — might strike one as a surprisingly small effect for a $1000 per month basic income pilot.</p>
    <p>Which might be a shame! It would suggest only a modest wage increase if a genuinely universal basic income of that amount were enacted, assuming continued full-employment macro policy.</p>
    <p>But, at least directionally, it would suggest an increase in wages for a constant quantity of labor supplied.</p>
    <p>And recipients would enjoy the <em>per se</em> benefits of an extra $1000 a month, taken in some mix of cash and time for education, care, leisure, or entrepreneurship.</p>
