    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>The Republican Party has become in substance the American Nazi Party. Most Republican voters, most Republican electeds, did not intend to belong to the American Nazi Party, just as most Twitter users did not intend to be producing content for a Nazi website. They just found themselves there. The alternatives still displease them, it's hard to know what to do. It's forgivable. However, the longer you continue to self-ID as a Republican, the less forgivable it is. You don't have to become a Democrat. Just don't be a Republican. If you are an elected, you have a harder burden. If you don't want to be a Nazi, you do have to cease to caucus with Republicans. If you are a House member and a vote for Speaker is held, you must at the very least withhold your vote from Republican candidates.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>If you voted for Donald Trump, you needn't feel guilty and you needn't apologize. It was not remotely clear at the time of the election that the new administration would violate black letter law and procedure to access and expose private and classified data; would decimate the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DUlk">already understaffed</a> civil service; would illegally shutdown vital agencies and literally <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/us-aid-freeze-claims-first-victims-as-oxygen-supplies-cut/">kill people</a>; would impound lawfully authorized payments; would destroy the foundations of American science and technology; would destroy America's alliances and threaten its neighbors; would ship migrants to camps in Central America with no public transparency as to conditions; all in a continuing attempt at <a href="https://www.liberalcurrents.com/is-it-a-coup/">autogolpe</a> that rather <a href="https://masto.ai/@aguleb/114027523072321084">parallels</a> Hitler's program in 1933. Yes, lots of people did loudly warn you. But our politics have become so polarized, so tabloidized, that a person of good will could have taken all that noise as self-serving hyperbole. Professional Democrats might have shouted Trump is Hitler, but neither the Biden Administration (hi Merrick Garland!) nor Democratic electeds in the run-up to the election really acted like they believed that. While Biden was still hanging on, when asked how he'd feel if he lost to Trump, he <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-anchor-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-biden/story?id=111695695">infamously said</a> "I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that's what this is about." Those aren't the words of a person who truly believed his loss would mean elevation of an American Hitler. (To be fair, Elon Musk's role was far less clear at that time.)</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>If you voted for Donald Trump and you are a person of good will, you do in my view need to recognize that you erred. In good faith you participated in what turned out to be a bad enterprise. At the very least you have an obligation to withdraw your support.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>If you promoted Donald Trump, if you arrogated to yourself any role influencing others to support his election — among friends, on social media, in public writing — you are a locus of accountability. You do, in my view, have a positive obligation to communicate your error at least as powerfully as you once communicated your support, and to work to minimize the damage the movement you helped elect will do. Welcome to the resistance. It's better to be cringe than to crime against humanity.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Republicans are in substance the American Nazi Party. That oughtn't prevent one from recognizing that the Democratic Party is pretty terrible. In my view, the Democratic Party has made itself a jobs program for insiders. It consistently puts reelection and seniority-based promotion of incumbents before effectiveness at promoting the values of its supporters, or even governing effectively. No matter how much it fails it demands ever more cash to enrich a charmed circle of consultants. Culturally the party is a nest of risk-averse careerists, from which their timidity, their infamous "fecklessness", results. And yet. Democrats have the virtue of being the not-Nazis currently available. You save the country with the champions you have, not the champions you might wish to have.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>The first order of business is to impeach and remove Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Mike Johnson. That's the only remedy we have within our Constitutional system. If possible, we should avoid joining the Nazis in stepping outside our imperfect but perfectly workable system. Obviously, at the moment, impeachment and removal is a pipe dream. But it can become an inevitability quickly, once Republican Congresspeople understand the absolute toxicity of this administration to the American public.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>We are the American public. It is our business to behave in ways that communicate to our sheltered, gerontic representatives the toxicity of this administration in ways they can neither ignore nor write off as the mischief of an unrepresentative activist class.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Obviously phone and write your Congresspeople. Obviously, but really! Frequently! Communicate your shame over the actions of the administration and your loathing of anyone who enables its reckless, awful, behavior.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Our vulnerability to Nazi takeover derives in part from having substituted media for direct, human-to-human interactions with other another. The current emergency is a great opportunity to reverse that. Get in touch. Phone people you haven't spoken to in years. Rekindle those connections. Do that for its own sake. But also communicate, respectfully and without arrogance, the necessity that people of goodwill now participate in politics in ways they might understandably have absented themselves in the past. Encourage your friends also to phone and write their Congresspeople. Get together with people you haven't gotten together with so much to discuss the issues of the day, to make phone calls or write letters together. Host parties.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Demand meetings with your representatives, whether person-to-person, in small groups, or "Town Hall"-style public events. Communicate plainly and energetically that the current administration and the political apparatus that supports it are evil. If our representatives are to represent us, they must work to end the administration and to see that apparatus disgraced.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Consider frugality, as a matter of personal risk management, and as a vote against any justification an evil administration might make on the basis of a supposed go-go economy. Now is a great time to build a giant cushion of savings if you can.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Consider relocating outside the US, hopefully temporarily, as a matter of personal risk management, and as a means of withdrawing your contribution both as producer and consumer from an economy superintended by malign forces. Especially if you have children, if you have means to do so, creating an "outside option" is just wise.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Consider diversifying from US assets, especially absurdly overvalued US equities. I hesitate to say this because I've a conflict of interest. I try (but recently have failed rather spectacularly) to make my living largely through financial speculation. I am often short US equities. I am now. So this advice is self-serving. Nevertheless, I think divesting from US equities is ethically called-for. (I <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/07/10/cornering-the-future/index.html">thought</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/20/a-simple-theory-of-the-stock-market/index.html">it</a> ethically called-for even before this administration, but "now more than ever".) Obviously use your own judgment, ethical and prudential. But while our political system has largely denuded the vote of its expressive power, the American state remains relentlessly attentive to the level of the S&amp;P 500.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Demand Congressional reform. A return to the <em>status quo ante</em> of state paralysis will sow the seeds of yet another disorderly, destructive paroxysm to try to right the ship. The total abdication by Congress of its role and function in our Constitutional system is the deep root of our catastrophe. The three branches of government may be coequal in legitimacy, but Congress is supreme in its power and authority. It's Article I, motherfuckers. We should not be surprised we experience <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3204739-the-crisis-consists-precisely-in-the-fact-that-the-old">morbid symptoms</a> when the very heart of our system of government has stopped beating. We need electoral reform, so that the House is elected by proportional representation, so that citizens can replace the two legacy parties — one evil, the other torpid — with organizations each of us can find homes in, which will vigorously represent our interests and values. Senators should be elected by approval voting, so that they have incentive to represent their state's entire public, rather than rely upon copartisans, their "base". We also require reform of the arcane procedure that rigs the process of legislating within the two chambers of Congress. This needs to be simplified, made legible to and subject to critique from the broad outside public, and reformed to diminish <em>status quo</em> bias and disproportionate power based on seniority. The legislative branch must be massively restaffed, so it sustains expertise internally and does not depend upon lobbyists and donor-funded think tanks to write legislation. Term limits should be universal. Institutional know-how should subsist within parties, rather than in the persons of "experienced legislators" who create tradeoffs for voters between legislative effectiveness and their own values.</p></li>

      <title>Might Elon Musk be personally liable?</title>

    <p>I am not a lawyer. Thus the title of this post is a question.</p>
    <p>But, as a layperson, it seem to me there's a pretty good case that Elon Musk might be personally liable for the damage he is causing.</p>
    <p>There are contexts in law and life where we purposefully limit people's liability, because we believe it would discourage valuable activity if we held them liable for harms that might arise from their conduct. Corporations — and their progeny, LLCs, LLPs — limit the liability of businesspeople, and importantly make possible low-information passive investing. If shareholders of a corporation were held "jointly and severally liable", as is the default for a business enterprise with multiple owners, it would be way too risky for ordinary people to ever hold a single share of, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_explosion">British Petroleum</a>. Corporations also often indemnify board members and officers from any liability that might arise from performance of their duties.</p>
    <p>The same concerns arise in government. The US Constitution <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S6-C1-3-1/ALDE_00013300/">explicitly immunizes</a> Congress for its work. Courts have deemed it necessary that certain officers of the state, most controversially police officers, be understood to have "qualified immunity", so they can do their jobs effectively and without undue fear. The Supreme Court has <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">recently (apocalyptically) determined</a> that the President has at least a presumptive if not absolute immunity in His official acts.</p>
    <p>However, by default, we are all potentially liable for our actions. Businesspeople have to perform certain legal formalities in order to achieve the protection of the corporate form. Even after they have done so, if they engage in serious misconduct or use the liability limitation as an instrument of fraud, courts may <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/piercing_the_corporate_veil">pierce the corporate veil</a> and impose personal liability.</p>
    <p>Government officials are no doubt protected by a variety of forms of immunity and indemnification from torts that might arise as a result of their work. But, obviously, for those protections to arise, a person must actually be acting as government officials. Some threshold must be achieved that marks their status as protected public official rather than ordinary private citizen.</p>
    <p>Even among <em>bona fide</em> government officials, if they use their access to the accoutrements of the state in a manner not authorized by law and clearly beyond the scope of their official role, then surely they are liable. If an off-duty FBI agent on a personal vendetta shoots up your truck with her Glock, the fact that the Glock was issued to her by the government does not shield her. A stalker who works for NSA is no less a stalker for having abused the tools at his disposal to spy on you.</p>
    <p>Elon Musk is creating a lot of concrete harm for a lot of people. Every sack of USAID food stuck now in a warehouse somewhere would have been feeding someone, but for his intercession. People's children are going hungry and perhaps dying. People on experimental courses of treatment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/usaid-clinical-trials-funding-trump.html">have lost medical supervision</a>. These are serious harms.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, Musk is <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886307316804263979">likely substantially responsible</a> for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/usaid-families-have-their-lives-upended-by-trump-move-shut-agency-2025-02-08/">uprooting</a> workers at USAID and placing them unlawfully on indefinite administrative leave. Repeating <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/05/elon-musk-email-fork-in-the-road-resignation-email-federal-workers/">a move</a> he perfected at Twitter, it was apparently Musk who introduced <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/02/opm-fork-musk-trump-federal-personnel-management-employee.html">disruptive changes</a> into the terms of employment of tens of thousands of Federal civil servants. These too are serious harms.</p>
    <p>Dangerous intrusions into the privacy of American citizens and businesses, apparently at Musk's direction, have already occasioned <a href="https://fedscoop.com/judge-blocks-treasury-payments-systems-from-doge/">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-and-18-states-sue-trump-doge-access-privacy/">injunctions</a>. If our private information has been pilfered by Musk, was he properly acting as an agent of the state?</p>
    <p>With respect to civil servant employment, commentators have warned that the terms of the "buyout" offered apparently at Musk's behest might be unenforceable by the courts because they had not been lawfully authorized and so no cognizable contract with the American state exists. If that is correct, if Musk caused the issuance of documents that appear to be contracts with the state but in fact are not, wouldn't that constitute a form of fraud for which he could be personally liable? Let Musk, personally, pay until September whoever takes up those offers.</p>
    <p>Musk allegedly <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-special-government-employee-what-does-that-mean/">does have</a> some sort of formal state affiliation now. He is a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Government_employee">special government employee</a>". Special government employees are usually outside experts who serve temporarily in advisory roles. They face fewer ethics and conflict of interest rules than an ordinary Federal employee. The theory, I guess, is that it shouldn't be burdensome when government officials need to tap outside expertise, and an advisor cannot directly abuse power. Whatever actions result from an advisor's work will be ultimately undertaken by an accountable permanent employee.</p>
    <p>Does this status occasion any form of immunity? If so, what are its parameters and limitations?</p>
    <p>We do not know when Musk actually obtained this status. Did he improperly direct elements of the state prior to being granted formal status, in ways that may have caused serious harms?</p>
    <p>Once this status existed, if such a person arrogates to himself a role of directing state action rather than advising, if he then directs state action that is in contravention of law or lawful procedure, how is that different than our FBI officer shooting up someone's truck in a personal vendetta? Sure, instrumentalities of the state would have been used by a sometimes immunized official. But the person would have been doing things that are unauthorized and unlawful and entirely out of scope from the formal position they have been granted. Would general statements of the President's support for the officer, or even specific support after the fact, immunize our FBI officer? It seems unlikely that the President directed Musk's actions, in their particulars and in advance.</p>
    <p>The President of course can pardon Elon Musk with respect to Federal crimes. But the President cannot pardon civil suits, even those that arise under Federal law. The President cannot pardon civil suits or criminal prosecutions at the state level. By bullying civil servants into fake contracts, Musk has arguably perpetrated fraud against people who live in lots of American states.</p>
    <p>Musk is best understood not as an instrumentality of the new administration, but as an agent who — in his personal capacity, in pursuit of his own commercial and ideological interests — has usurped control of instrumentalities of the state. He may have lacked sufficient status, authorization, scope, and adherence to lawful procedure to render him entitled to any form of immunity for the vast, foreseeable, preventable harms that his actions have caused.</p>
    <p>I am not a lawyer. But Musk should be personally liable for the wreckage he so <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/claytoncubitt.bsky.social/post/3lhiejffk5c2h">carelessly</a> has wrought.</p>

    <p>I use the term "soft information" <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/14/seeing-like-a-ceo/index.html">quite</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/02/11/situated-versus-unsituated-virtues/index.html">a</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/26/banks-should-fail-much-more-often/index.html">lot</a>, but I think it's unclear to readers what I mean, and what "hard information" would by contrast mean.</p>
    <p>"Hard information" (think "hard data") is often taken to imply true or accurate or reliable information. That is very much not what I intend when I use the term. Usually when I am writing about hard and soft information, I am advocating greater reliance upon soft information, or lamenting our institutions' inability to make use of it. That'd be pretty dastardly, if by hard information I meant good information and by soft information I meant bad.</p>
    <p>My definition of "soft information" comes out of the banking literature I once studied as an abortive finance grad student. It's kind of a puzzle, I was taught, that banks even exist. Finance types, or at least finance types of the still very neoliberal aughts, treated markets as the best information aggregators the humans ever invented. Loans are marketable. When you and I want a loan, why don't we just issue a kind of personal commercial paper, and let potential lenders bid on the debt, establishing our market interest rate?</p>
    <p>Okay, you and I are small potatoes, so maybe "frictions" in issuing marketable securities explain why personal loans don't work this way. But businesses take bank loans too, sometimes pretty big ones!</p>
    <p>The traditional resolution of this puzzle is "soft information". A bank has intimate information about the businesses who bank with it. It can observe a whole arc of history, how revenues flow and how stable or unstable they are, how reliably the business pays its bills and what kind of cushion it maintains. Bankers often know the principals of their business customers personally, and develop opinions about their character, which J.P. Morgan himself, um, <a href="https://libquotes.com/j-p-morgan/quote/lbt8g6m">characterized</a> as the most important information in a credit decision.</p>
    <p>Some of the information bankers superintend can get aggregated into a credit score — hard information! — but much of it is simply not accessible to the rest of the market. Evaluations of character in particular depend upon personal contact, and are ideally drawn from longstanding, continuing, human-to-human relationships.</p>
    <p>So, the theory went, banks exist, or at least exist as lenders to business, because bankers can outperform markets in pricing debt, because they have superior information. Bankers have access to all the same "hard information" other lenders would have, but also to this "soft information", available only to them.</p>
    <p>If soft information is information only available to a particular party by virtue of its relationship with the subject of the information, by virtue of its <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/02/11/situated-versus-unsituated-virtues/index.html">situatedness</a>, then hard information is information whose content and provenance is accessible to everyone, information that is unsituated.</p>
    <p>A score issued by a credit bureau is "hard information" because every potential lender can access it and observe the same value. Although the reporting that informs the score is private, the procedure by which the scores are computed is broadly public. Sure, details might be proprietary. Everybody understands that structuring the computation had to involve making choices that were discretionary, that might have been made differently. If you disagree with those choices, you might argue the scores are inaccurate. But the credit bureaus make those choices, and promise to perform their scoring <em>consistently</em>. Lenders accept the scores, and take them as a pretty good proxy for creditworthiness.</p>
    <p>More than that, because everybody sees the same information, "hard information" can serve as the basis for public conversations in a way that a banker's soft information cannot. Civil servants and the interested public can deliberate and conclude that 620 should be the minimum score for a borrower whose loan will be purchased by a government-sponsored agency. We perceive this criterion as "objective". Since we will all have the same "hard information" about a given borrower, we can all evaluate whether they are eligible. J.P. Morgan might object that crucial aspects of character are not captured by the credit score. But we'd have a hard time structuring a national bureaucracy around information accessible only to people with personal relationships to the borrower.</p>
    <p>But J.P. Morgan was undoubtedly right! If we could in some trustworthy and dispassionate way incorporate the experience of people who know the borrower best, we'd find plenty of cases where it would in fact be wise to lend to a person with a low credit score, and be unwise to lend to a person with a high score. But "we" constituted as a large bureaucracy — public or private! Bank of America as much as Fannie Mae! — have no such trustworthy means. "We" do not know the borrower. "We" do not know and have little reason to trust individuals from whom the borrower might solicit character references. Independently scouting such evaluators would be costly, and the problem of evaluating our putative evaluators' character is no less difficult than evaluating the character of the borrower.</p>
    <p>So, in public discussion and in large bureaucratic contexts, we necessarily rely on hard information <em>even though we understand it to be inaccurate</em>. We acknowledge the information condensed into a credit score is imperfect. Nevertheless we often treat it as though it is the thing itself, rather than at best a noisy proxy of a thing we wish to measure. If there are two otherwise similar borrowers, one has a credit score of 550, the other has a credit score of 650, we lend to the latter because she is "creditworthy", and deny the former because she is not.</p>
    <p>The fundamental character of hard information is not "accuracy" or "quality", but its susceptibility to serving as the basis of social convention. We need to talk about things, to reason together, to decide together. Almost everything of interest to us is not directly accessible to our senses. Your and my "gut" evaluations would not be consistent with one another, could not provide a basis for consensus in our decisions. Often we have no perfect or even good measures of the thing of interest. So we invent something, as least-bad as we can. We make the arbitrary choices we have to make to define and structure a public measure, because something is better than nothing.</p>
    <p>Fabricated hard information like this is everywhere. What's the "inflation rate"? The US Bureau of Labor Statistics does its very best — really! But it necessarily makes arbitrary choices, applies <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/quality-adjustment/hedonic-price-adjustment-techniques.htm">hedonics</a> to commodities with quantifiable measures of quality but omits them for goods without, etc. The Consumer Price Index it publishes gives us "hard information" by which we publicly reason about inflation. But different choices might have been made than those BLS makes, and those might yield different numbers and very different conclusions, especially over long periods of time.</p>
    <p>Has the "real income" of the median household grown over the last two decades? Under one set of numbers yes. Under another measure which, say, took into account the effect of <a href="https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soc4.12884">income segregation</a> on the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150572">affluence of neighbors</a> as a form of housing quality, it might not have. Neither measure would be incontrovertibly more or less "accurate" than the other. But it's likely that one would become conventional, would predominate in public debate, would come to be taken as "the fact of the matter".</p>
    <p>The susceptibility of hard information to convention, to standing in for fact, means that it often serves to engender a very authoritative kind of groupthink. The information, however well-intended its construction, will along some dimensions, for some purposes, prove inaccurate and inadequate.</p>
    <p>Are Americans happy with their health insurance? After UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was murdered, I saw incredulous responses on social media pointing to <a href="https://files.kff.org/attachment/Topline-Survey-of-Consumer-Experiences-with-Health-Insurance.pdf">polling</a> that said 81% of respondents rated their insurance excellent or good.</p>
    <p>It's not a secret in everyday American life that a lot of people really hate health insurance companies. Insurers are perceived as making tragic situations even more miserable by virtue of the bureaucracy they impose on the sick and those who are forced to advocate for them. They are perceived as contributing to the death (murder?) of patients upon whose treatments they impose delays. Your cancer won't wait for prior approval. It's metastasizing while they mull.</p>
    <p>Yet prior to Thompson's murder, this thing that everybody knows was largely inaccessible in policy-oriented conversation. Are people unhappy with their health insurance? The polling says no. You can bring in your anecdotes, how mad your cousin was, how your friend died after the imaging was delayed. But you could come up with as many stories of people having great experiences! The hard information says 81% of patients are happy with their insurance.</p>
    <p>Thompson's murder has brought attention to some obvious-in-retrospect considerations. When we are judging the satisfactoriness of something, the intensity of dispreference of a dissatisfied minority can matter. Dissatisfaction on behalf of others' experience rather than ones own can be relevant. (There's a literal survivorship bias in polling customers' own health insurance satisfaction. A disproportionate fraction of people who personally suffered awful experiences are no longer around to be polled.)</p>
    <p>We can construct measures that try to address these things. But we didn't before. Our conventional hard information blinded us. Data-driven groupthink laughed off claims that the experience of the insured was a burning problem. The policy community focused on universality rather than quality of coverage, and praised itself for the success of ACA on that score.</p>
    <p>If hard information risks a kind of upscale groupthink, should we rely upon soft information instead?</p>
    <p>Unfortunately reliance on soft information yields its own pathologies. When we rely upon information accessible only to particular people by virtue of their situation or perceived expertise, we cannot evaluate the quality of decisions. We open the door to unfairness in decisionmaking, sometimes intentional, often even when decision makers are doing their very best. Relying on soft-information decisionmaking risks corruption.</p>
    <p>Most obviously, if someone is going to be trusted to make consequential decisions based on special information and judgment that others cannot evaluate or verify, who's to say the decisions aren't motivated by self-interest? On the basis of purported soft information, I lend the bank's money to my own friends and family more freely and at lower rates than to others. Perhaps by informal arrangement my own prosperity rises with that of my friends. Perhaps what I actually know, through my vaunted soft information, is my friend will make speculative investments with the money and cut me in on any gains, while she'll fail to repay the bank if things don't work out. If my cut will be big enough, the upside might be worth risking my job.</p>
    <p>One might try to police conflicts of interest, ensure that whenever decisiomakers might have, or might even be perceived to have, a personal stake in the outcome, of course they should not be trusted to judge. But then you might condemn yourself to the worst of both worlds. You are relying upon a decisionmaker's purported special information while insisting she only decide under circumstances where in fact she lacks any special information. A perfectly ethical loan officer will have the bank lend to a person she has known forever and considers a friend in preference to others with "objectively" similar creditworthiness, if part of what she knows is that the friend would be mortified ever to default on a loan and would move heaven and earth not to. That's not a violation of the trust the bank has placed in her. On the contrary.</p>
    <p>A worst-kept secret of finance is that the entire project of investment banking is <a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2011/01/some-people-never-learn.html">built on managing, rather than eschewing, conflicts of interest</a>. Top M&amp;A firms do not compete on price, but on the thickness of their rolodexes and the trust they have engendered in the investment community. Firms looking to raise capital understand that bankers will offer access to good customers on sweetheart terms, at prices where there is still money to be made. They calculate the <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/1781.html">"money on the table" they lose from underpricing</a> will be more than compensated by the number and wealth and quality of investors the schmoozy bankers bring into the deal. Perhaps this works out best for everyone. Firms raise more money than they would have via any alternative channel, and investors expect and get good deals from bankers they trust. Perhaps not, and one or both sides of the transaction gets told all this as a kind of fairy tale while they get screwed. The trouble with soft information is it's hard from the outside to tell. Often it's hard from the inside to tell!</p>
    <p>In the United States, we reflexively equate "nepotism" with corruption. Opportunities should be distributed according to degrees, or exam scores, or some qualification that can be expressed on a resumé as verifiable, hard information.</p>
    <p>But that's too easy, and dangerous. Nepotism can be wise, and not only for corrupt reasons. I may know about competences and character traits among family and close friends that no test score can easily capture. I might actually know my nephew is well-suited the job, even if his resumé is inferior to other candidates I know less about. If the job is high stakes and I set aside my soft information to go with the best resumé, I risk a consequential mistake.</p>
    <p>The difficulty is that outsiders — and, in many cases, the decisionmaker herself — cannot easily distinguish between corruption and wise use of soft information. If I think, <em>I love my sister and my nephew so I'll give him a great job</em>, then hiring him is corrupt. If <em>I know my nephew is ethical and hardworking and unusually insightful about exactly the sort of problems he will face</em>, then hiring him may be wise. Of course, I may persuade myself of the latter when I am motivated by the former. And you, on the outside, have no way to tell which is which.</p>
    <p>The "good government" impulse to avoid this challenge by relying on hard information only is not sufficient. Hard information is also imperfect. If I hire the best resumé from Harvard, I can <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3513.html">justify the choice and no one can blame me</a>, but it may well be entirely the wrong choice, if what we actually care about are outcomes. People who style themselves meritocrats like to imagine that talent is both abundant and objectively demonstrable. In many contexts, neither is true. Being precious about appearing above corruption can itself be a corrupt choice. I protect my own reputation at the expense of the cause I am pledged to serve.</p>
    <p>Even when a decisionmaker uses soft information impeccably, when she makes the best choice possible given her full information set, soft information decisionmaking is susceptible to <em>structural corruption</em>.</p>
    <p>I know, I know. That sounds like "critical race theory". Chris Rufo is going to come and <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/27/new-college/index.html">destroy something else I love</a>. But the mechanism is so straightforward even Chris could understand it.</p>
    <p>A banker strives to make credit decisions as best she possibly can, with no bias whatsoever in terms of race or religion or nationality or other irrelevances. But our banker has her life and her own social circle. It is quite likely that her family, friends, and near acquaintances are not distributed among races and religions and nationalities in proportion to their frequency in the population.</p>
    <p>When our banker receives a loan application from someone in or near her social circle, she has meaningful soft information that can help guide her choice. When she receives the same application from outside her social circle, she does not. Given two candidates who are in fact creditworthy, it's quite possible she will be able to recognize the quality of the candidate within her social circle, but be unsure of the candidate outside of it. Soft information decisionmaking introduces a structural bias towards choices that the decisionmaker has special information about, even though there may be equal or superior choices elsewhere. Our banker is making the best choices she possibly can, using all of the information at her disposal, but from the outside it will appear that she is biased towards the races, religions, and nationalities prevalent in her own social circle. It's the structure of her acquaintanceship, rather than any invidious discrimination, that introduces the bias.</p>
    <p>So, where do we go from here? Relying solely on hard information does not in fact capture all of the good information that ought to go into making a decision, and leaves decisionmakers susceptible groupthink, mistaking conclusions drawn from flawed but conventional information sources for the best decisions. Relying freely on soft information renders it almost impossible to police corruption, and leaves even honest decisionmakers susceptible to personal or structural bias.</p>
    <p>What to do? I hope to think more about this in future pieces, but a difficult truth is answers will themselves be context dependent. It takes soft information to design roles and incentives under which decisionmakers can fully exploit all the information at their disposal, neither falling back lazily to the most easily defended hard-information criteria, nor abusing (consciously or otherwise) the trust placed in their soft-information judgment.</p>
    <p>What I hope I can convey for now is "evidence-based" or "data-driven" is not in fact a recipe for high-quality decision-making. High quality decisions in practice require recourse to information that cannot meet a standard of public evidence, and skepticism of information that appears to meet such a standard. That this is hard to discipline doesn't render it any less true.</p>

    <p>The politics of migration from poor countries to rich is structured by <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9548.html">exploitation</a> and segmentation.</p>
    <p>For a migrant flow to be politically sustainable in the destination country, the migrants should constitute a labor force which</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>[<em>exploitation</em>] works under conditions that would be considered exploitative from the perspective of natives of the rich destination country (although not necessarily relative to the norms of the source country);</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>[<em>segmentation</em>] works under those conditions only in segments of the labor market that citizens of the destination country have effectively withdrawn from and ceded to migrants, so that the migrant flow doesn't undermine natives' bargaining power in their own labor markets.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When societies are unequal and divided, the <em>incidence of the surplus from exploitation</em> also becomes important. The case for immigration to natives is that "we all" benefit from exploitation of their labor. If the surplus value is thought to be captured by private bosses, rather than shared with the public in the form of low consumer prices or social democratic benefits, that will undermine the case for immigration.</p>
    <p>Immigration from poor countries is not so controversial in places like the UAE or Singapore. "Guest workers" have extraordinarily limited rights. They work in roles that native Emiritis and Singaporeans understand as proper to immigrants and do not seek, and are widely understood by natives to provide benefits that are broadly shared. We live like kings because they work like paupers.</p>
    <p>Immigration from poor countries becomes controversial in places where immigrants are, or are perceived to be, supported rather than exploited. <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/06/denmarks-immigrants-forced-out-government-policies">Denmark</a> might be an example. Instead of natives exploiting immigrants (popular!), immigrants are seen as exploiting or harming natives (not popular!).</p>
    <p>Even when immigrants clearly do work under exploitative terms, immigration becomes controversial when migrants compete in the same labor markets as native workers. Then — even if "in aggregate" the destination country benefits from exploiting the migrant labor force — workers whose bargaining power is undermined become cross. Questions of the incidence of the surplus from exploitation come to the fore. Is immigration just a tool by which the rich get richer while immiserating and exploiting their own fellow citizens?</p>
    <p>In liberal states and social democracies, many of us have high-minded ideals, and pretend that migration from poor countries to rich should be embraced on moral grounds, rather than on the basis of exploitation. However admirable those ideals, this often yields unsustainable policy and dangerous backlash.</p>
    <p>Regardless of good intentions, migration yields its benefits and costs. Natives will in fact enjoy a surplus or bear a burden, the surplus from exploitation net costs of service provision and social disruption. Elements of society will experience an incidence of those benefits and costs, so even immigration that is net positive for natives may impose steep costs on certain groups.</p>
    <p>Framing migration in moral terms invites overlooking unsupportable costs, or celebrating benefits that are narrowly captured by some natives while imposing costs on others. It's great to believe that accepting migrants from difficult circumstances is a moral obligation. But that doesn't absolve us of carefully accounting for the burdens and benefits of taking on that moral obligation. It doesn't excuse us from building consent for our choices among the democratic public, or from ensuring that any burdens and benefits are shared fairly, another moral obligation.</p>
    <p>If you are "for immigration" in ways that don't seriously take these questions into account, you are for immigration only performatively. Those of us who do see immigration in moral terms should try to give immigrants as good a deal as is politically sustainable. That is, rather than try to maximize the surplus we extract from our immigration policy, as Singapore and UAE do, we should seek to vouchsafe from immigrants unmistakable benefits for natives, but for a limited tenure, while they "pay their dues". We must still exploit, enough that the migrant flow more than compensates its burden, providing natives with benefits that are widely recognized and broadly distributed. But once the cost has been covered, we can welcome them as coequal citizens rather than take them for all we can squeeze.</p>
    <p>In the United States, we do not in our public politics think clearly about these issues. We put things mostly in moral terms, pitting cosmopolitan human rights against against communal rights to protect ones kith and way of life. Framing things in terms of rights, as always, prevents us from thinking clearly about trade-offs and compromises.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, over the years, the United States has found equilibria that quietly embrace the twin pillars of exploitation and segmentation. We criminalize a migrant labor force while winking at the businesses that employ them. The function of criminalization, of course, is not actually to <em>prevent</em> the flow of migrants, upon which many businesses quite depend. We criminalize in order to minimize the bargaining power of migrant workers, and maximize exploitation on behalf of natives. Spokespeople for industries like agriculture and meatpacking are quite candid that, absent this labor force, our food prices would be higher. (The cynical among us are left to wonder how much of this surplus from exploitation actually finds its way into lower prices for consumers, versus how much pads profits and managerial salaries.)</p>
    <p>We all quietly understand that these industries are segmented. Hand-harvesting of ground crops is "work Americans don't want to do", which means it's work Americans would not consent to do at the wages and under the conditions that criminalized, exploited laborers accept. In exchange for cheap food, Americans withdraw from these labor markets, cede them to maximally exploitable migrants.</p>
    <p>Exploitation. Segmentation.</p>
    <p>We all understand this bargain, even if we pretend we don't. Democrats get performatively mad at mistreatment of migrant workers, but don't actually upset the apple cart. Republicans sometimes make a show of pretending criminalizing immigration means "really, no illegals". They quietly, quickly, <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2023/06/08/desantis-ships-migrants-texas-gop-legislators-beg-them-keep-working-florida-column/">walk it back</a>.</p>
    <p>For agricultural labor, we do have a more civilized alternative, the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-temporary-agricultural-workers">H-2A visa</a> for temporary farm workers. It's conceivable we could expand this program to regularize the status of the people doing "work Americans don't want to do", exploit them just a bit less, but keep the basic contours of the deal in place. The H-2A program respects a labor market segmentation we as a political community have now tacitly accepted.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations">H-1B program</a> does not. The H-1B is for high-value white collar work that Americans broadly would love to do. It brings migrants from poorer countries under exploitative terms, because workers are placed at risk of losing immigration status if they lose their jobs. So H-1B workers tolerate wages and works condition less generous than native workers accept, or would accept absent competition or threat of replacement by H-1B workers.</p>
    <p>Exploitation and segmentation are twins. If a class of migrants is not exploitable, then its labor needn't be segmented.</p>
    <p>The United States offers a range of <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/employment-based-immigrant-visas.html">employment-based immigration visas</a>, under which workers labor with roughly the same security and on close to the same terms as US citizens. More migrants come to the United States under these visas than via the H-1B program, with almost no controversy. These visas are extended to people who are expected to do high-value work. The work, and the taxes that result from it, are presumed to be contribution enough to the welfare of other Americans.</p>
    <p>Employers <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1872374103983759835">like to pretend</a> the H-1B program is used like the "<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1">Einstein Visa</a>", as a way to recruit the most extraordinary foreign talent to play for Team America. But if that's the case, the appropriate visa is an employment-based immigration visa, not the intentionally precarious, notionally temporary, H-1B.</p>
    <p>The H-1B program exploits the workers it recruits, but fails to segment the exploited workforce from native labor markets. We can argue about magnitudes, but this has the plain economic effect of reducing native worker bargaining power, and the predictable political effect of enraging native workers. One might conspiratorially attribute the allocation of H1-B visas by lottery rather than by salary not to poor design, but to the possibility employers value the program not so much for the employees it permits them to hire, but for its ability discipline labor across the salary spectrum.</p>
    <p>On both moral and practical grounds, I favor more rather than less migration. I have a soft spot for the H-1B program, because I have friends who'd not be here without it. Nevertheless, it is a bad program. Accepting a class of immigrants on terms that render them exploitable relative to native workers without ensuring that the labor markets they participate in are segmented from the work natives pursue is class warfare.</p>
    <p>The right way forward is to fold the H-1B program into employment-based immigrant visas. Existing H-1B holders should be able to trade their status for EB visas. Currently, roughly 140,000 employment-based immigrant visa are allocated each year. Including slots for professionals with advanced degrees, up to 85,000 H-1B visas are made available. We should just expand the employment-based immigrant visa program to 225,000 per year and call it a day.</p>
    <p>American firms should indeed recruit the very best talent from India and everywhere. When they do, the American government should hand these remarkable people green cards, rather than hand their employers a weapon, a cudgel, a threat they deploy against both migrant workers and their native colleagues.</p>

    <p>“<a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/12/20/wreckresentative-democracy/index.html">Wreckresentative democracy</a>” is the name I’ve given to what stands in for representative democracy in the American system.</p>
    <p>Rather than meaningful, collaborative, representation — which we do not and cannot have, when our “representatives” are charged with “representing” almost 800,000 randos — we content ourselves with constraining the assholes who pretend to represent us, by wielding a credible threat to “throw the bums out” if they do something we dislike. We don’t have representation, but we retain some influence by virtue of our capacity to wreck politicians' careers.</p>
    <p>Most of us are of course happily, rationally ignorant of whatever our “representatives” are or are not doing. So how can we sustain any credible threat?</p>
    <p>Human beings are wired for outrage and <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5911.html">altruistic punishment</a> as means of enforcing pro-social behavior. So while we remain rationally ignorant of most things our legislators do, including the “good things”, we are primed to sense scandal, betrayal, and to punish it.</p>
    <p>The fact that the role of public participation in our democracy is almost entirely negative — we punish rather than guide — explains a lot about how our politics actually function. A few years ago Simon Bazelon and Matt Yglesias <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-rise-and-importance-of-secret">pointed out</a> that while Congress often seems hopelessly gridlocked, a lot of constructive activity occurs in what they termed “Secret Congress” — when legislators quietly get together to hash out deals about issues with little public salience, outside of the spotlight of media and partisan controversy.</p>
    <p>This makes sense in the context of “wreckresentative democracy”. Whatever action is taken on any salient, polarizing public controversy, it will create losers for whom the action will be a betrayal. It will create winners too. But most of the public will not perceive itself directly as winners. Losers will make a case to a mostly disengaged public that the legislation was an act of treachery. They will try to power up the wrecking ball of public revulsion, encourage coalescence behind an impulse to punish.</p>
    <p>Legislators enjoy little electoral advantage from the engaged sliver of the public that perceives an action as virtuous, but faces a serious risk that the engaged sliver that perceives itself as losing will gin up an electorally dangerous reaction. Inaction is close to costless. Action on matters of open controversy is dangerous.</p>
    <p>Note that this is a pathological result of “wreckresentative democracy”. It simply would not occur under genuine representation. In an actually representative system, constituents would not be 800,000 random citizens with widely divergent values and interests, but some much smaller number of people who actually share similar views that a representative could understand and advocate. The particulars of a legislative proposal might be obscure to constituents. Representation exists to absolve ordinary citizens of those details. But when a public controversy erupts, the position taken by a representative will be straightforwardly related to interests widely shared by her constituents. She might win or lose, but constituents would feel represented rather than betrayed regardless.</p>
    <p>The gridlock we take for granted on matters of sharp controversy, the paradoxical result that “democracy” can only progress when it addresses matters the electorate is too ignorant much to care about, all result from the asymmetry of incentives built into wreckresentation, where constituents have little means to reward a “representative” but they can sure as hell punish.</p>
    <p>Bee-sting theory is a name <a href="https://x.com/interfluidity/status/1435076577587433475">I gave</a> to a view expressed by David Shor, that political parties are basically always punished for bold action. You might call it the opposite of "<a href="https://prospect.org/politics/case-for-deliverism/">deliverism</a>".</p>
    <p>In Shor’s view, when a political party wins power, it can and sometimes should do big, important things, because that’s what political power is for. But like a bee choosing to sting, it is undertaking an action that will grievously harm it on behalf of some greater good. It should not expect to be rewarded, electorally. It should expect to lose, and should act only when the political cost will be worth it.</p>
    <p>A common interpretation of the phenomenon Shor describes is <em>status quo</em> bias. "The electorate," intone sad politics-knowers, "often <em>claims</em> to want change but in fact hates to see its habits disturbed."</p>
    <p>I think Shor is onto something descriptively, but the <em>status quo</em> bias story is wrong. There are times — not at all rare times! — when much of the public actually does want bold change from their government.</p>
    <p>However, proponents of any particular bold change are mixed together in the same constituency with people who would absolutely oppose the change, and with a much larger group that has never given the matter much thought. In a genuinely representative system, people would have been presorted into constituencies that would favor the change and constituencies who wouldn’t, and enacting the change would not be electoral poison for representatives of the former. In our wreckresentative system, where people pretend to represent huge populations that are not meaningfully sorted, the bigger the change the more easily it can be spun to the politically less engaged majority, by those who oppose the change, as a terrible betrayal.</p>
    <p>What looks like <em>status quo</em> bias in the electorate as a whole is not that at all. It is an artifact of asymmetrical incentives that "representatives" face due to how we have structured electoral and legislative institutions. An infantilized electorate without meaningful representation, with no real influence except its capacity to lash out, lashes out.</p>
    <p>Although I have <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9069.html">my fancier ideas</a>, conventional multiparty proportional representation would go a long way towards fixing this.</p>

    <p>There’s little meaningful "representative democracy" in a polity like the United States. There never really has been.</p>
    <p>Your “representative” in Congress allegedly represents almost 800,000 people, people with whom you have nothing in common other than geographic proximity, if even that after all the oddities of gerrymandering. We teach our children we live in a representative democracy when the claim is very obviously absurd.</p>
    <p>Europeans and political scientists may object that meaningful representation comes via the intermediation of political parties. Political parties are smaller, and by virtue of self-selection, more homogeneous than the polity as a whole. In theory, a person might be enfranchised <em>within</em> their political party by actively participating in it, and then be enfranchised <em>via</em> their political party in a parliament or legislature. Proportional representation means that all parties then are represented, according to their support within the population.</p>
    <p>Regular readers know I <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/15/state-capacity-and-authoritarianism/index.html">strongly</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">favor</a> electoral reform to bring multiparty democracy to the United States. So far be it from me to piss too hard on this parade.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, even if we had six rather than two national parties, they would still, from the perspective of most citizens, be distant institutions run by insiders to whom most of us would have little access. Representation is a matter of degree, and multiparty parliamentary democracies do a better job of it than America’s destructive duopoly, but even in well-arranged parliamentary systems the claim a parliament is “representative” is a stretch.</p>
    <p>What would it mean for a law-making body to be representative? What are we actually after?</p>
    <p>Much as I am fond of <a href="https://equalitybylot.com/">sortition enthusiasts</a>, I don’t think what we want is a representative sample in a statistical sense. Lawmaking is an activity most of us have little expertise or inclination toward. The whole point of “representative democracy” is to delegate the task to specialist-experts, who by definition are unlike most of the rest of us, who become even less like us by virtue of being formally employed as “representatives”.</p>
    <p>In social affairs, statistical independence is the exception, correlation is the norm. The ways that specialist-expert representatives are different from the rest of us will bring divergences between that group as a class and the rest of our interests and values. There is no getting around this. If you choose legislators by sortition, they will be “representative” only until the moment they take their unusual job, school themselves in unusual skills, become overwhelmed by the generosity of well-wishers and lobbyists with whom ordinary constituents rarely truck. Representatives cannot be representative. Precisely because they are representatives, they are different.</p>
    <p>I think that the version of representation we are after is the version generally provided by the legal profession. When we hire a lawyer, we don’t do so because we imagine that she is “like us”. We do so because we imagine that the skills our attorney could bring to bear would be effective at advancing our values and interests, if only she would wield those skills on our behalf. So we hire her, we pay her, to wield those skills on our behalf.</p>
    <p>But in order for the arrangement to work, "we" — the people doing the hiring — must have a coherent set of values and interests she can advance. We must actively, persistently communicate to our attorney what those values and interests are. Her role is to listen and understand our interests as we understand them, help hone them into something actionable and coherent, and then to develop effective means of advancing them. Although it is not her role to gainsay what we understand our own interests to be, it very much is her role to provide expert feedback about the relationship between various tactics we might consider and the likelihood of actually advancing those interests.</p>
    <p>Effective representation doesn’t come from who our attorney <em>is</em>. She <em>is</em> nothing like us. Effective representation results from an active collaboration between the represented and the representative, and active supervision by the represented.</p>
    <p>In <em>status quo</em> American democracy, this kind of representation certainly does take place. But the “client” cannot be the electorate that gave our representative her perch. The very idea is incoherent. Those 800,000 people disagree among themselves, often strongly. They do not share the same values and interests.</p>
    <p>No, election as a representative doesn’t in practice mean a person represents the incoherent mass that is “their constituents”. It simply places a person in a position where they can choose what values and interests actually to represent. Some people who are elected have strong allegiances to a preexisting set of values, and they work to advance those, collaborating with people they understand to be important proponents of those values. That sounds noble, but keep in mind the values to which they are so strongly committed may be diametrically opposed to those of a significant fraction of their constituents, who are left not unrepresented, but anti-represented.</p>
    <p>Most electeds are more pragmatic. They effectively sell their advocacy in the same way that a lawyer might. Election simply places them in a position where they have something valuable to offer in the marketplace that otherwise they would not have.</p>
    <p>In any case, there is no meaningful collaboration with and supervision by “their constituents” as a whole. There cannot be. Constituents do not share a coherent set of values and interests that anyone could collaborate to advance.</p>
    <p>If we want meaningful representation, we would have to move towards a very different system, something like <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9069.html">mass representative democracy</a>. But we are very, very far from such a thing.</p>
    <p>This has been a pretty bleak presentation of <em>status quo</em> representative democracy. I think accurately so! One reason why people are not so exercised to save “Our Democracy” is because most of us do not perceive ourselves to be meaningfully represented in the democracy that we are supposed to save.</p>
    <p>And yet.</p>
    <p>The actual practice of American-style “representative” democracy is somehow a lot more open, a lot less indifferent, than the picture I’ve painted. Representatives do not and cannot meaningfully represent the mass of their constituents, no. But they are nevertheless desperate to be liked. They cannot represent, but they still have to win the next election if they are to keep their job and the opportunities it brings.</p>
    <p>So in lieu of representation, we get pandering. Our representatives publicize the least contentious things they do, tell us in our newsletters how hard they are working for us, bend over backwards to offer “constituent services” in order to communicate that they are on our side. In safe partisan districts, we get fairy tales of heroes and villains, in which Our Noble Representative stands up to the corruption and perfidy of the Bad Political Party.</p>
    <p>Elected officials’ desperation to be liked offers a back-door simulacrum of actual representation. We cannot collaborate with our representatives to affirmatively advance our values and interests. But we can threaten punish them when they work against us. We can badmouth them, run ads against them, primary them. We don’t have representation, but we have “wreckresentation”. We can’t make them work on our behalf, but often we can frighten them away from working against us. Not always. Where controversies are aligned with partisan allegiances, representatives in non-swing districts can safely choose their party’s side with little fear of punishment. But when a representative might wish to work against a faction in their own party, or take a position on a controversy not yet calcified along partisan lines, they risk being villainized, demonized, becoming unliked and electorally vulnerable.</p>
    <p>The system feels “open” because even though we cannot gain representation, our “representatives” assiduously crave our approval. It’s not enfranchisement, but flattery can be a consolation prize. We do have some genuine capacity to manipulate elected officials, by threatening to render them dislikable. That’s not representation, but maybe “wreckresentation” is the next best thing.</p>
    <p>It may be over, however. “Wreckresentation” is becoming professionalized. AIPAC, of course, has been a pioneer, systematically surveilling American politics for dissidents against their version of a pro-Israel position, in order to disparage and destroy electeds who fail to toe the line. This cycle, the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/07/pro-crypto-super-pacs-pouring-tens-of-millions-into-2024-elections/">crypto industry</a> adopted the same playbook. And Elon Musk, whose brave new scale of expenditures dwarfs all who came before, now <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-threatening-fund-primary-212351051.html">threatens in general</a> to wreck the careers of anyone not with his program.</p>
    <p>The desperation of elected officials to be liked, their fear of scandal, is the heart of what’s left for ordinary Americans to perceive as “our democracy”. We don’t have representation. But we do have the people we elect constantly pandering to us and currying our favor. As the fear of organized interests comes to overwhelm concerns about pissing off random groups of constituents, as more and more it is Elon Musk rather than constituents whose favor must be curried, this last affective vestige of “democracy” may too, like so much else, wither and die.</p>

    <p><em>This post is dedicated to John Roberts.</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>People I talk to whose worldview is close to mine often profess a sense of bafflement:</p>
    <p><em>I mean, they are just destroying this country. It's one thing to want to win, to want to run the place. But what's the point of ruling a country if you turn it into a cesspool of corruption?</em></p>
    <p>The "<a href="http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/001705.html">Iron Law of Institutions</a>", propounded by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/schwarz.bsky.social">Jon Schwarz</a>, offers one potential answer.</p>
    <p>I want to offer a less cynical explanation. Perhaps where we see corruption, our opponents see virtue. Is "influence peddling" such a problem if the pedlars are, well, a good influence?</p>
    <p>We tend to see collective action problems, tragedies of the commons, self-interested, transactional decisions that compose to catastrophes no one could want.</p>
    <p>What if to our opponents these outcomes are not catastrophes at all, but great successes, a righting of wrongs?</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/11/19/plutocracy-as-a-positive-ideal/#a-republic-if-you-can-keep-it" id="a-republic-if-you-can-keep-it" name="a-republic-if-you-can-keep-it" class="anchorlink"></a>A republic if you can keep it</h3>
    <p>From the moment of the American founding, our "republican form of government" has been Janus-faced.</p>
    <p>To most of us, in most of our civics classes, a "republic" just means representative democracy. Unqualified "democracy", direct democracy, doesn't scale. It suffers from information problems, as high-quality lawmaking requires more attention and expertise than can be expected of ordinary citizens, if we are to have lives and a prosperous economy as well.</p>
    <p>In a "republican" system, rather than participate directly in lawmaking, our information problem is simplified to periodically electing full-time professionals to represent our values and interests in the lawmaking process. Fundamentally, the system remains democratic. We've just settled upon a more practical, effective structure for government of the people, by the people, for the people than pretending we can run legislatures millions of citizens strong.</p>
    <p>But the republican form of government makes an appeal to a quite distinct tradition, also strong at the American founding.</p>
    <p>Under this second tradition, all men are not equal in real life, regardless what they were when our Creator endowed them. Some men are fit to rule. Other men and women are fit to serve.</p>
    <p>In a well-ordered nation, the best men must rule. This is an edict not of any parochial interest or self-dealing faction, but of nature itself. It serves the interest of all.</p>
    <p>A slave may have no control over his circumstance, yet be much better off than if he did, when his betters order a world in which his labor contributes to a prosperity that, in due measure, he also enjoys.</p>
    <p>Whatever it is called — "Congress", "Parliament" — the republican form of government vouchsafes a kind of aristocracy. The great virtue of a republic, in this tradition, is that it attaches to this aristocracy institutions of notional consent, easing the burden leaders always face of persuading the ruled to submit to those who rightfully rule them.</p>
    <p>The US Constitution was the Barack Obama of its time, fresh-faced and inspirational and sufficiently vague that different factions could project their own hopes onto its form. Idealists inclined to democracy could scry within it an improvement on the Athenian tradition. Entitled men who fancied themselves practical saw clever machinery for manufacturing consent in rule of the country by its natural rulers.</p>
    <p>We frequently discuss particular deformities framers of the Constitution adopted to ensure its ratification — "equal suffrage" of the states (and therefore radically unequal suffrage of citizens) in the Senate, counting slaves as three-fifths persons, the odd formula behind the electoral college. But the republican form of government itself — is it a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/duck-and-rabbit-illusion-b1821663.html">duck or a rabbit</a>? is the dress <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/heres-why-people-saw-the-dress-differently.html">gold or blue</a> — was the Constitution's main trick, allowing political opponents to rally together behind one document they interpreted quite differently.</p>
    <p>Ever since, of course, we have been fighting over just what kind of document it is. On paper a duck and a rabbit may be contrived to take a single form, but in life the two animals behave distinctly.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/11/19/plutocracy-as-a-positive-ideal/#money-as-a-martial-virtue" id="money-as-a-martial-virtue" name="money-as-a-martial-virtue" class="anchorlink"></a>Money as a martial virtue</h3>
    <p>Traditionally aristocratic lineages distinguished themselves in war. Men who were natural rulers held land, taxed peasants, raised armies for their own glory or to serve the even greater glory of the king. Men who held and taxed land, or who won the debt and favor of the king, became noblemen and ruled, as God and nature intended.</p>
    <p>By the American founding, commerce was already vying with conquest as a source of wealth and power. Nevertheless, suffrage under the early Constitution was <a href="https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/learn/deep-dives/who-voted-in-early-america/">usually restricted</a> to men who owned land, a reflex of deference to the natural ruling class.</p>
    <p>Following the Industrial Revolution, however, the notion that land ownership uniquely demarcated the best and most capable became both normatively and practically unsustainable. Surely the claim to greatness of some ranch owner paled in comparison to the conquests of an industrialist like John Rockefeller. Just as surely, men like Rockefeller had the means to ensure that their interests would not be subordinated to those of a gentry that fancied itself Jeffersonian.</p>
    <p>Proponents of aristocratic republicanism are not, have never been, mere throwback feudalists. Like all living traditions, aristocratic republicanism has adapted with the times. Rather than land, the marker of right-to-rule has been increasingly recast as wealth, money. In centuries past, men proved their mettle on horseback with lance or rifle. Now men contest for greatness on the terrain of business. In either case, the best men, those worthy of rule, are the winners.</p>
    <p>This has nothing whatsoever to do with your dorky economics textbook. The basis for deference to winners isn't because they must have provided goods and services at higher quality or lower prices than their rivals. It's because they fucking won. The more unfair the contest, the more impressive the victory.</p>
    <p>Business is the successor to the pillage and conquest that created duchies, kingdoms, empires. What of the theories of Friedrich Hayek? Milton Friedman? Bandits who style themselves kings have always hired balladeers to recast their pillage as glory unto God, service to the greater good. Even now, now more than ever, they extravagantly groom jesters and fools.</p>
    <p>Antitrust is abhorrent to this tradition. Antitrust is for slaves. When the Huns poured from the steppes and overtook Europe, could defenders lay one hand horizontally across their other hand held vertically, call "time out" and demand that referees inspect the rulebook?</p>
    <p>No. They fucking fought and fucking died. Or else they killed, held their patch of land and therefore continued to rule.</p>
    <p>In a fallen world chock full of slaves, people contending to be masters recognize no higher authority. The idea is abhorrent. They themselves are the highest authority, or else they are a corpse.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/11/19/plutocracy-as-a-positive-ideal/#lineage" id="lineage" name="lineage" class="anchorlink"></a>Lineage</h3>
    <p>Emperors do not concede that their domains must crumble when frailty overtakes their skin and bones. The quality that martial or business conquest reveals, in which inheres the right to rule, must subsist, then, not in individuals but in families, lineages.</p>
    <p>You can put this in terms as dweeby as you want. Just like they hire their Milton Friedmans, they hire their Charles Murrays and Arthur Jensens, balladeers who sing a different key. Men who rule are not "following the science" about genes and DNA and heritability. It simply is an axiom they require, that the unit of analysis for human quality should be lineage rather than person. Clever slaves can write up the textbooks.</p>
    <p>You have your axioms. They have theirs. Don't imagine that you fool yourself any less when you choose the foundations for your version of "reason".</p>
    <p>In any case, to understand the behavior of aristocratic republicans, you must understand that among them, excellence and awfulness, capability and cravenness, are characteristics of families rather than individuals. A just political order weighs and sorts whole lineages, rather than particular individuals. Inheritance is just, because it is the lineage, not the person, that conquers, accumulates, and so <em>earns</em> the spoils of conquest.</p>
    <p>Every family will have its black sheep, its morons, its fail-sons and squanderers. All of that is noise, the private business of great families to address. Usurpers and strivers who trade in gossip about such characters in order to contest the status of the lineage should be crushed.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/11/19/plutocracy-as-a-positive-ideal/#the-constitutional-order" id="the-constitutional-order" name="the-constitutional-order" class="anchorlink"></a>The constitutional order</h3>
    <p>From the perspective of aristocratic republicans, the purpose of the Constitutional order is to durably and reliably elevate the best to rule, while cloaking that coronation as the result of "democratic contestation", reflecting "consent of the governed".</p>
    <p>But there is always a danger that forms of democratic contestation might give way to substance, to an order in which mobs of lesser men and women grasp the reins of power and do mischief — not least to their own interests, as unsuited men elevated to rule inevitably do.</p>
    <p>So there must be a kind of dance. On the one hand, the forms of institutions must be sufficiently "democratic" or at least "legitimate" to cultivate the voluntary submission upon which a peaceful, prosperous order depends. On the other hand, the institutions should not be so "democratic" as to permit among the unworthy more than token representation in the halls of power.</p>
    <p>Suppose there were some kind of council, a chamber in which <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx">robed wise men</a> could fine-tune and reconfigure the institutions that are only vaguely sketched on the several pages of the American Constitution.</p>
    <p>Congress must be elected. Inadequate vigor on the part of the council's predecessors has rendered universal formal suffrage a <em>fait accompli</em>. The Senate as well as the House is now directly elected.</p>
    <p>Perhaps in time these errors can be reversed. But holding actions are needed now. The best men — recognizable as the richest men — must rule, despite institutions that insist on formal equality for all.</p>
    <p>What would you do?</p>
    <p>If there must be elections, you might <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/310/">ensure that the best have influence over those elections</a> as <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/185/">mighty as they can muster</a>.</p>
    <p>Elections are managed at the state level, and some states are, unfortunately, run by governments beholden to the other republican tradition, villainous mob democracy.</p>
    <p>But some states are not. States that are run under virtuous, aristocratic republicanism — if they given <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/570/529/">freedom to manage how elections are run</a>, or to <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/588/18-422/">strategically define electoral districts</a> — will vigorously use those powers to elevate men suited to rule, or men and women who can be counted upon to do those men's bidding.</p>
    <p>States that rule in the democratic republican tradition will refrain from using these powers with full, cold-eyed vigor as a counterweight. To do so would be to violate and undermine the very democratic norms they are besotted to protect. Idealists rather than warriors, they are hobbled. (Idiots. Fools. How could one trust such men to rule?)</p>
    <p>With great effort, considering several decades of backsliding, elections have been reoriented towards what the founders (at least those in the aristocratic republican tradition) intended — plebiscites that imbue legitimacy to rule by natural rulers.</p>
    <p>But the republic is large, messy. Some states are still run by usurpers, idealists, communists, "democrats". Unworthy men and women will, unfortunately sometimes be elected, and placed in positions where they can do real harm to the interests of the republic, even to interests they would understand as their own, if they were not so unworthy.</p>
    <p>So it is important that the best men retain channels of informal influence, by which they can guide and tutor men and women who rise above their station. They must be permitted to <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/603/23-108/">reward</a> the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow">best</a> and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/598/21-1158/">worst</a> alike for acting correctly.</p>
    <p>When the Constitution was debated, the danger of mob rule was well understood by men in the aristocratic republican tradition. They calculated that, between the institutional safeguards ("checks and balances") within the new Constitution and attention to the administration of elections, the mob could be simultaneously coöpted and kept at bay. There have been some difficult decades, but patriots are now well on their way to restoring that balance. Elections are less and less a threat.</p>
    <p>Men who seek election are usually ambitious and vain. That is providential, because such men can be bought by those who have proven suited actually to rule by achieving and sustaining great wealth.</p>
    <p>Over the past few decades, however, a new threat has emerged, one that was not foreseen by the founding generation. A "professional civil service" — peopled by men of modest ambition but tremendous pride, confident in false moral and social theories — has arrogated to itself much of the state's capacity to govern. By virtue of their limited ambition and dangerous theories, this class of people is somewhat resistant to remunerative tutelage by their betters.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, these "professionals" are very devoted to the notion of service in the context of paid employment. Establishment of a <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/">revolving door</a> between professional roles in government and "private sector" jobs arranged in their interest can usefully serve to educate them.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, as a class, they remain vexatious and dangerous.</p>
    <p>Happily, this class can be cast as illegitimate under <em>both</em> the aristocratic and democratic republican traditions, by virtue of being insulated from the influence both of money and elections. As at the founding, adherents of these two grand traditions, marinated in the best "common sense" money can buy, join together in a common goal — routing the influence of "unelected bureaucrats".</p>
    <p>We are now well on our way to <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/603/22-451/">neutralizing</a> <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/603/22-1008/">this</a> <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/">pox</a>.</p>
    <p>Yea and truly, we are finally restoring the American founding.</p>
    <p>One side of it, that is.</p>
    <p>Duck or rabbit, gold or blue. In the end, there can be only one.</p>

    <p>I think most people misunderstand what constitutional democracy is all about.</p>
    <p>A constitutional democracy is not a system in which a king or aristocracy stands periodically before a popular plebiscite. You do not live in a constitutional democracy if, every eight years, you reaffirm the autocrat, even if the affirmation is not coerced, even if it reflects genuine support (whatever that might mean in the context of a media environment that the autocrat controls).</p>
    <p>Under the US Constitution, the President is not supposed to be king. Congress is not a ruling aristocracy.</p>
    <p>The point of a constitution in a constitutional democracy is to define a web of procedures and relationships that constructs a whole quite distinct from any of its parts. State action should result from deliberation and contestation in which <em>all</em> interests and values held by members of the polity play a role.</p>
    <p>Melting pot is the metaphor, not battleground. We construct a common mind together, an “artificial intelligence” that none of us dominate or control, but within which all of us have some influence.</p>
    <p>Of course we frequently disagree with one another. Our common mind must sometimes choose between mutually exclusive courses of action. So in that sense, some of us win, some of us lose, love is a battlefield.</p>
    <p>But even when we lose, we condition the results. Our arguments that haven’t won the day contribute to risk management, as “winners” of the argument address our concerns as much as possible consistent with the project we have chosen. No one has been excluded or locked out. Choices have been made, not by some of us against the will of others, but by all of us together, even as some will be delighted by those choices and others bitterly disappointed.</p>
    <p>Ideally this “mind” is constantly working, frequently acting across a wide range of concerns. We all “win some” and “lose some”, not every two years in occasional elections, but every day and week. The mind is wise because it aggregates and weighs the experience of all of us who compose it. We accord it legitimacy, we “trust” it, because we see our own values and interests reflected in the portfolio of choices it delivers, even though we all “lose” frequently with respect to particular choices. “Turn-taking” should be as fine-grained as possible.</p>
    <p>Obviously this is none of our experience of contemporary American government, or of contemporary American life. We are sharply divided into two tribes, many of whose members see themselves as substantially sharing values and interests which the other tribe viciously opposes. Each group wrestles to control the state in bitter, zero-sum contests. Every two years we fight over which tribe will be aristocrats, and which tribe subjects. Every four years we have a grand fight over who will be king.</p>
    <p>We constitute together no wise common mind. Deliberation gives way to propaganda, a necessary evil given all the lies the other guys are telling. Losers get shut out, rather than see their insights incorporated into our common project. We become collectively incapable of coherent, adaptive, effective action. The actions we take are rendered ill-informed and cartoonish as we become intoxicated by our own side’s propaganda.</p>
    <p>We are where we are. But it’s worth taking a moment to remember that this is not our system working as intended. This is dysfunction, pathology, atrocity. Constitutional democracy in which we are ruled by none and all, in which state action emerges from a common mind we together constitute, is possible, achievable. It has nowhere ever been perfect, but it has often been better, here and elsewhere.</p>
    <p>We are on the verge of giving way to cynicism and reverting to tyranny as a more practical and capable, if brutal, form of government.</p>
    <p>I’d rather we understand how and why we’ve simplified, calcified, infantilized ourselves into absurd, moronic factions, and work to undo that. We actually can improve the institutions by which we collectively deliberate and choose and act.</p>
    <p>Constitutional democracy remains possible. You, dear reader, have your own values, interests, and perspective. For me, I am quite sure constitutional democracy would be far superior to the <em>status quo</em> to which we’ve devolved, much better than the brash alternatives all the strivers and grifters tout and shout in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S5TIQCdPZI">clashing cacophonies of bitter enthusiasm</a>.</p>

    <p>Is it still worth trying to make sense of how US elections work?</p>
    <p>Elections always change — I’d like to see US elections <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/15/state-capacity-and-authoritarianism/index.html">change dramatically</a> — but I worry that the most likely changes going forward may render Tuesday's election the last Presidential election really contestable for a while.</p>
    <p>I hope I am just paranoid.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless.</p>
    <p>To understand this election, and other US Presidential elections of the recent past, I think that you should divide your analysis into two parts.</p>
    <p>Part I, and only Part I, is the issues game. The candidates each try to position themselves on issues of public concern in a manner that renders them maximally popular. However, since it is a competitive game, both candidates are strongly incentivized to achieve at least 50% support. And there is no prohibition on copying. The result of this game almost always is that, by the time of the general election, “decided voters” break <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">pretty close to 50:50</a>.</p>
    <p>The population of “decided voters” is not invariant to how the issues game is played, however. On many, perhaps most, issues, one position seems popular, so both candidates “tack to the center”, adopting a position as close as they can to the popular view. When both candidates do this, the issue becomes a matter of consensus rather than electoral competition (and portions of the public that disagree with the consensus are left disenfranchised and alienated).</p>
    <p>For example, in this year’s campaign, Harris converged towards Trump’s position on immigration. Trump converged towards Harris’ position on abortion.</p>
    <p>Because of their prior expressed views, or constraints imposed by their coalitions, candidates may lack credibility to fully neutralize issues this way. But a candidates’s public embrace of a position goes surprisingly far. Despite the clear antiabortion maximalism of much of the Republican Party, Trump’s assertion he would not impose further restrictions at a Federal level, along with the availability of remedies like ballot initiatives at the state level, seems to have been effective at eliminating an expected source of motivation among women voters to prefer Harris.</p>
    <p>In the limit, both candidates could converge to nearly identical, popular positions. But then there’d be little basis, at least in terms of issues, by which decided voters might decide. The more the candidates converge on issues, the less issues become determinative of the outcome. A greater fraction of the electorate comes to decide based on matters other than "the issues".</p>
    <p>Candidates converge more than you might expect, and not always because they both want to take the most popular position. In our oligarchic system, the two parties can and often do agree that <em>neither</em> will take a popular position, because elites or donors in both parties dislike it. Both candidates tacitly agree to adopt a less popular position, removing the issue from the pressure an election might otherwise exert. Most Americans <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/09/10/polls-arms-embargo-israel-weapons-gaza/">say</a> US weapons should be withheld from Israel, but neither candidate offered that position, so it could not become a dimension of electoral competition.</p>
    <p>There are always some issues over which the candidates ultimately choose to contend rather than converge, or where one candidates’ attempts to converge just aren’t credible. “Character” I think should count as an issue in this sense. An appearance of “good character” is something both candidates would converge upon if they could, but in practice the ability of one or both candidates to credibly do so may be limited.</p>
    <p>So. Some fraction of the public decides the way you were probably told you are supposed to, based on "the issues", including “character”. But that fraction gets divided pretty close to 50:50, because both candidates adjust their stated commitments strategically to achieve 50%, and empirically it seems rare that difficult-to-adjust commitments like character impose too great a handicap.</p>
    <p>Which brings us to Part II.</p>
    <p>The marginal voter, the motherfucker who decides the election, is rarely an issues voter at all.</p>
    <p>As the issues game plays out, the “decided voters” are never precisely divided 50:50. One candidate can have an edge, which translates <em>ceteris paribus</em> into an advantage, a bias, going into the second part.</p>
    <p>But as long as the pool of voters unmoved by the gaps left open in issue-positioning is larger than the advantage one candidate has achieved in the issues game, the election will always ultimately be decided by something else.</p>
    <p>Part II is the <a href="https://laist.com/news/npr-news/the-likability-factor-what-obamas-lacking">“beer primary”</a>, the vibes, likability, people going with their guts. It almost always decides the election.</p>
    <p>Suppose that 80% of voters do decide based on issues (including character), and among those 80%, one candidate would achieve an extraordinary 60% of the vote. That candidate would begin Part II with an incredible advantage. She’d only need to win 10% of the undecideds.</p>
    <p>But she does have to win that 10%! The issue-undecideds will have the final word, unless an extraordinary fraction of the public decides based on the small sliver of openly contested issues, and their decision is extraordinarily lopsided. If only 70% decide based on openly contested issues and one candidate leads with a more plausible 55%, that candidate still has to win almost 40% of the voters who were left unmoved by the issues, or else she loses.</p>
    <p>It’s not true, as people cynically suggest, that “issues don’t matter, it’s all emotion, all vibes” in US Presidential elections. But the system we have, in which there are just two parties who converge, due to the popularity of some positions or mutual agreement, on most issues, who then competitively sculpt the space of contested issues into something close to a tie, the fraction of voters left undecided by the issues becomes large, and the bias imposed by issue positioning becomes weak.</p>
    <p>Further aggravating the situation is the empirical observation that people’s guts, vibes, whatever are surprisingly correlated with one another. Even if a candidate leaves the issues game with a strong win, so they only need to win over 40% of undecideds, if 70% of the undecided are ultimately going break in one direction or the other, that big issues advantage proves to be no advantage at all.</p>
    <p>So, in this system we’ve built for ourselves, even if strong majorities of voters decide based on issues just like your civics teacher said they should, elections are ultimately won or lost based on… something else.</p>
    <p>What is that something else?</p>
    <p>In the Bush-Gore-Obama era it was who you’d prefer to have a beer with, given candidate personas as large media outlets portrayed them. We used to have private lives that were in-person and personal. The public sphere was whatever large media organizations crafted it to be.</p>
    <p>Today, we don’t really have personal spheres fully distinct from the media sphere. Much of our personal life gets mediated through digital platforms of one sort or another. Our media mimic and blend together with our personal digital relationships. We interact online with people we trust, sometimes because they are our friends in an old-school way, but often because <em>they comport themselves like friends</em> even though the interaction is one-way and our companions don't know us from Adam. Their friendly conversational vibe and the frequency with which we accept their company tricks deep mammalian emotions into an inference that they are in fact friends.</p>
    <p>I think Donald Trump won this election because he and his surrogates made themselves <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/creators/donald-trump-107a4Qug6y/appearances">parasocial superstars</a>.</p>
    <p>Kamala Harris did podcasts, but she treated them as interviews. Her campaign conceived of them as extensions of traditional media hits. She followed the traditional rules politicians master, she stuck to her talking points. She <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/10/15/politics/kamala-harris-charlamagne-tha-god">openly boasted</a> that her very scripted style constituted discipline. Which it did! She never made a gaffe!</p>
    <p>Trump and his surrogates said <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/10/27/politics/fact-check-trump-rogan-podcast">stupid wrong stuff</a> all the time. It didn’t matter. Issues decidable people who chose Trump because they like tax breaks or whatever didn’t treat whatever Trump spouted on Rogan or Fridman as scary. They developed their information about his issues positioning through other means, and just wrote off whatever he or Vance or whoever was saying as shooting the shit, mouthing off.</p>
    <p>When people shoot the shit and mouth off among friends, they exaggerate. They speculate. They bullshit. They boast. Considering potentially outrageous stuff and talking it through is something we do only among close friends, because that kind of exploration might get us scolded or worse in other settings. The kind of loose-lipped bullshitty candor that Harris eschewed for fear of an old-school gaffe is exactly what communicates intimacy. In the context of this (false) intimacy, this simulacrum of a private conversation among friends, words that might count as dangerous public commitments in an NPR interview become tentative, deniable, mere fleeting thoughts bounced off confidants.</p>
    <p>It’s not that Trump is some kind of digital code-switching genius. He talks this way everywhere. It’s always locker room talk with Trump.</p>
    <p>It just turns out that, by 2024, someone had invented locker rooms that fit millions of people, but that simulate for listeners the same low-consequence intimacy. (<em>Codeswitch Note: Do not call it “intimacy” when you are actually in a locker room.</em>) People who in fact know nothing about Donald Trump feel like he’s a good guy they can trust, even if — in a sense because — he acts like a dick a lot.</p>
    <p>I wish Kamala Harris had done Rogan. But the one hour interview she assented to wouldn’t have done it. Rogan was doing her a favor, when he insisted on sticking to his three-hour conversational format. But even had she accepted, she would have bombed if she had continued to try to pass off caution as discipline. She would have had to make the audience feel like insiders. It would have had to be confessional, dangerous. And by that point, it couldn’t be. Trump could cloak himself in having publicly said so much awful shit, any new awful shit rarely seemed newsworthy. The issues game was immunized from Trump’s bullshitting in a way Harris’ hair-down misremarks would not be. Harris had an edge on character that she could only lose. And it was too late, in the last week of the campaign. Parasociability takes time, repeated presence rather than repetition of talking points.</p>
    <p>I hope that, in terms of character and policy chops, Trump proves to be an aberration, a crisis we survive again without too much damage done. But as a matter of style, he may be the future.</p>
    <p>As we revert to a kind of massive, preliterate village, if we retain an electoral system in which the vibes decide, the people we elect will increasingly be our “friends”.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I strongly expected Kamala Harris would win, did not predict the actual outcome. I considered what has in fact occurred unthinkable. So take my analysis with whatever grains of salt that merits.</p>

    <p>So, tomorrow is Election Day. Perhaps you've already voted, one way or another. If so, good for you. If not, and you are an eligible US citizen, please vote.</p>
    <p>Voting is not, actually, the essence of our democracy. The essence of our democracy is the respect we have for one another, day by day, one by one, as equal citizens, whose values, interests, and perspectives we mutually thirst to understand. No expert can see the world through your eyes. Plutocrats spend billions of dollars mostly to avoid having to walk a millimeter in your shoes. In a certain respect, the true enemy of democracy is pride. It requires tremendous humility to let other people's experience and ideas and hopes and grievance have play, in our own minds, in our political institutions, on equal terms with our own. No matter how rich you are or how much you know, when it comes to the values and interests of any other person, you cannot and do not know better.</p>
    <p>Our electoral system in the United States is poorly arranged. I devote a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/15/state-capacity-and-authoritarianism/index.html">whole</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">lot</a> of <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">ink</a> here to how we might fix it. Nevertheless, elections, such as they are, are an important institutional embodiment of our democratic ethos. In practical terms they are much of what, at least ideally, gives real-world consequence to the democratic ethos we aspire to live every day.</p>
    <p>You should vote for whomever you choose to vote for. I cannot, and would not, gainsay your understanding of the world, dear reader. But if you want to know my views, this election — perhaps for the first time in my life — I will "vote blue no matter who" up and down the ballot, even with some enthusiasm.</p>
    <p>You don't need yet another pundit to tell you that the political formation Donald Trump has conjured around his damaged human soul is fascist. It is, if that word has any <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html">meaning</a>.</p>
    <p>But the people who support Donald Trump are, for the most part, very far from fascists. We live in times when nearly all of us feel belittled and ripped off, threatened by forces beyond our control. Most Trump supporters mean to cast their vote against the know-it-alls and corporations they have come to believe — correctly in my view — now illegitimately dominate our collective lives.</p>
    <p>But Donald Trump is himself a plutocrat, not a counter to corporate and monied interests. He doesn't soak the rich when in government. Your annoying manager is rich, and pays you dirt, and treats you like shit, even while she mouths all kinds of platitudes about tolerance and antiracism and bullshit. Of course she is voting for the Democrats. Any enemy of hers, you think, is your friend, and she sure hates Donald Trump. But her real enemy is a union that gives you the power to tell her to fuck off. Donald Trump will crush the least possibility of a such a union while he plays dress-up as garbageman and fry cook.</p>
    <p>As I said, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Whitney Fox with real enthusiasm this time. I have "voted blue no matter who" before, but it was a hold-your-nose kind of thing. Joe Biden — working with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, I think — has changed that.</p>
    <p>I've been disheartened by people with whom I usually find common cause acting as if it's some nearly hopeless, sisyphean task to try to move the Democratic Party an inch when, under Joe Biden, the Democrats really did struggle to enact an extraordinary Build Back Better agenda. Despite failing, they managed to get some remarkable things done. We got the CHIPS act and rehabilitation of industrial policy as a thing we have to take responsibility for, rather than pretend not to have. We got the Inflation Reduction Act, which despite its stewardship by a mustache-twirling fossil-fuel villain, smuggled into being extraordinary green energy subsidies, and represents the first time the US policy apparatus has moved beyond conjectural and expressive "pledges" about global warming to actions that will have real effect. It's not enough! But it isn't nothing. Our current Supreme Court is <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">illegitimate, villainous, and traitorous</a>. It has done everything it could to prevent the Biden Administration from reducing student debt burdens past and future. (Biden's blocked <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/22/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-save-plan-the-most-affordable-student-loan-repayment-plan-ever-to-lower-monthly-payments-for-millions-of-borrowers/">SAVE plan</a> would be effing extraordinary!) Yet the Administration has worked strategically to circumvent the mock justices who still pretend they can interpret the Constitution for us, and gotten a lot of onerous past debts eliminated.</p>
    <p>On foreign policy, the Biden Administration has been a catastrophe. There is no sugarcoating that. From the shambolic withdrawal from Afghanistan that inevitably invited future mischief, to failing to deter the invasion of Ukraine, to abetting a genocide in Gaza, the Biden Administration foreign policy team has lurched this way and that, from no-more-forever-war-peacenik impulses at the beginning of its term to butt-hurt give-war-a-chance neocon idiocy towards the end, each time looking for isolated "wins" rather than hewing to a coherent strategy. (No, "democracy vs autocracy" does not constitute a coherent strategy.) I think we are all looking forward to turning a page on Biden's foreign policy.</p>
    <p>We'll turn a page no matter what. There is no information — zero, none — in Kamala Harris' refusal to put daylight between herself and the current administration. She plainly decided that, in the context of a bitter election, any "debate" that puts a wedge between her supporters and those more invested in Biden's foreign policy choices would divide and demoralize her coalition. The only information — <em>only,</em> whatever tea leaves you pretend to have read — we have about foreign policy under a Kamala administration is that she won't tell us. (She probably does not yet know herself.) I am fairly sure she would be better than Donald Trump. Even Joe Biden has been better than Donald Trump.</p>
    <p><em>(Sure, there were "no wars under Trump" if you don't count crushing ISIS and ramping up drone wars and arming the Saudis and completely hiding the extraordinary carnage of all of these operations from public view. But Donald Trump planted the seeds for the Afghanistan debacle by sidelining, undermining, emasculating the Afghan government that was our ally, then negotiating an agreement to withdraw and betray all of those we had promised to protect, a terrible agreement which Biden chose to fulfill rather than abrogate. Trump's Administration did do more to deter Russia in Ukraine than Obama's had, but with a perfunctoriness and half-heartedness made clear in the grounds for Trump's first impeachment. The sad fact is, no American President truly believed Russia would reopen World War II with a full-scale land invasion of Ukraine until it became clear, under the Biden Administration, after Afghanistan, that it would.)</em></p>
    <p>I am hoping that Kamala Harris is a continuation of the Biden Administration on domestic policy, and a break from the Biden Administration on foreign policy. Why do I give the Democrats credit for the former, while overlooking the discredit, the shame really, of the latter?</p>
    <p>The fact of the matter is I have <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/09/what-if-we-are-not-among-the-elect/index.html">no idea</a> what Kamala Harris will do, and neither do you. But the Biden Administration serves as an existence proof, that in fact the Democratic Party is not a mere conspiracy of its corporate wing to neutralize any progress towards civilization and social democracy. Harris could prove to be a regression, back to the awful Obama, Clinton version of the Democrats. She could prove to be a younger, more vigorous champion of social democracy, following in Joe Biden's footsteps but sprinting farther. She could stumble into the war with Iran that Biden and Binyamin Netanyahu have placed us on the verge of. She could champion a principled, <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/10/15/a-westphalian-order-is-project-enough/index.html">Westphalian</a>, basis for a new foreign policy consensus, over the (understandable!) wails of those who would (correctly!) score it as a retreat from 1990s-era hopes of universalizing human rights. Only the future will tell what Kamala Harris will do.</p>
    <p>We have a pretty good idea what Donald Trump will do, globally and domestically. None of it is any good. A real shot at making progress under Kamala Harris is far better than a near certainty of moral and practical catastrophe under Donald Trump.</p>
    <p>Yes, I will be voting <em>against</em> Donald Trump and his toadies and enablers. But I also think a Harris Administration really might continue the best and shed the worst of the Biden Administration. She might continue Biden's tradition of giving social democrats a real voice rather than corralling us in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091209012024/http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2009/08/07/rahm-goes-apeshit-on-liberals-in-the-veal-pen/">veal pen</a>. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, the bigger the better, would help enable a Harris Administration to actually move us towards a more civilized society, rather than cave to corporate interests and tout the "accomplishment".</p>
    <p>So I will vote, enthusiastically, for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Whitney Fox. I hope that you too will vote blue no matter who, this time around.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you disagree. This is all just me, the world as it I see. Tomorrow will pass, and I will still be eager to understand how you, dear reader, make sense of everything.</p>
    <p>However you see the world and your place in it, whatever your values and calculations about how best to steward those values through our very imperfect electoral institutions, I do hope you will take some time out of your day tomorrow to participate, to vote, if you have not done so already.</p>

    <p>If socialism is public ownership of the means of production and capitalism is private ownership of the means of production, then what is "social democracy", a "mixed economy"? The factory is either owned by the state, or it is not. Where is the middle ground?</p>
    <p>There are lots of answers to this question. Many are reasonable and they are not mutually exclusive. Some production can be performed by state-owned firms while other production is performed by private firms. Firms can be jointly owned, with some shares held privately and some held on behalf of the state. Firms may be notionally private while the state synthesizes a partial ownership position, deriving cash flows by taxing the firm and exercising control through regulation. In most contemporary economies, we observe all three of these forms of mixing, in varying degrees.</p>
    <p>I want to propose a different way of thinking about the question. <strong>In a mixed economy, we should consider <em>firms</em> to be substantially private, but <em>industries</em> to be a province of the public.</strong></p>
    <p>Firms are concrete. We transact with them, we work for them, we buy shares in them. But from a public perspective, what we care about is industries as a whole. If a firm is badly run, it may go bankrupt. That may be difficult for its private owners, but it is not the state's concern. What matters to the state is that, if this one goes under, that one takes over, or new ones appear. Through all the churn and competition, the public must remain continuously served. That is a characteristic of the industry, rather than of the firms that happen constitute it at a given moment.</p>
    <p>Of course, as individuals, we have preferences and relationships with particular businesses. But as a public, we are basically indifferent to firms when industries are well arranged. It is the industries that we rely upon.</p>
    <p>This sounds dismissive of firms, even mean. But it is this characteristic that renders it practical to think of firms as private at all! If the welfare of the broad public hangs directly on particular firms, then private control of those firms is <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/31/state-as-coordination/index.html">not private in its consequences</a>. In a democracy, management of such firms could not be left to some narrow, self-interested group of owners. Only the publicness of industries reconciles private ownership of firms with democratic control.</p>
    <p>What does it mean, in practice, to say that industries are public? It means first and foremost that defining market structure is a province of the state, and the structure so defined must preserve the publicness of the industry. The state must guard the frontier between firm and industry.</p>
    <p>Suppose a great and wonderful firm emerges, a fountain of efficiency that spews consumer welfare, whose shareholders content themselves with little. Absent state intervention, the firm, on its genuine merits, drives all of its competitors out of business. The public is delighted.</p>
    <p>The state must not tolerate that, any more than it would tolerate the emergence of a benevolent dictatorship with hereditary succession. The new king may be public spirited! He may ensure that his ministers consult excessively with citizens, to ensure that his rule balances and takes into account the preferences of all! He may teach his son to follow in his footsteps! But his son may prove less wise or virtuous or capable. That is why we insist upon political democracy.</p>
    <p>The very best firms begin like our benevolent king. Eventually, inevitably, they age into craven princelings. We structure the institutions of government to take the impermanence of virtue into account. We distinguish permanent roles from the transient tenures of humans who occupy them. We allocate roles by a mix of meritocratic competition and public consent, and then insist upon periodically reallocating them. We work to attract new talent and groom successors.</p>
    <p>Industries rule us as much as any other organ of the state. A demand the food industry makes as a condition of your child's nutrition is as irresistible as anything a police officer might require at the point of a gun. It is the state's duty to manage police forces to ensure they exercise only the minimal coercion necessary to enforce the law. It is the state's duty to structure each industry, so that it demands as little as is practicable to supply a full range of goods and services, while consistently innovating in both process and product. Private firms seek to maximize profit. Public industries must be architected to enable firms to enjoy ordinary “accounting” profit, while keeping the contest for "excess” profit challenging. Excess profit should be transient and aligned with improvements that trickle up permanently to the level of the industry.</p>
    <p>Like Federal lands, every industry is a public trust that requires active stewardship. Read this <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/10/29/train-drain/">wonderful piece</a> by Phillip Longman about the railroad industry, describing a history in which the state stepped up to its obligation, and then stepped down, with catastrophic results. (ht <a href="https://x.com/drvolts/status/1851697278463177067">David Roberts</a>)</p>
    <p>It is not enough for the state merely to counter monopoly — although the state should, must, aggressively counter monopoly. As Sanjukta Paul <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/double-standard-antitrust-law/">has emphasized</a>, "economic coordination of one kind or another is inevitable", because it is necessary. Absent an affirmative alternative structure, the emergence of one or a few dominant firms is simultaneously what antitrust law means to prevent, and yet the only path to orderly efficiency antitrust law leaves available, because collusion between firms is unlawful but coordination within firms is normal. "Break 'em up" is only the beginning of the state's role. The state must provide rules of a game under which firms can, and must, stay broken up, with each firm succeeding or failing on its merits while the industry as a whole thrives and delivers for the public.</p>
    <p>Industrial policy is all the rage these days and it should be. Forty years we wandered in a desert of delusion. We pretended we could have no policy and "the market" would choose for us the best and most optimal path. We are learning the hard way that what we do not manage we in fact <a href="https://x.com/michaelxpettis/status/1839192665109217386">concede to others who do</a>.</p>
    <p>But before we get into the business of choosing which firms to subsidize, we must ensure they are embedded in well arranged industries. We must make affirmative choices about the market structure we intend. We must define what constitutes the commodities bought, sold, and priced. We must design a tax and regulatory environment under which competing, profit-maximizing private firms will compose to the structure we desire.</p>
    <p>Of course policy’s twin is unintended consequence. We will err. But no invisible hand can do this work for us. We have to do our best.</p>
    <p>It is perpetually the work of the state — our work as a democracy — to define for each of our industries the market structure we desire, to design and then continually revisit policies in order to ensure the structure we target is roughly what prevails.</p>
    <p>And it is perpetually the work of the state to police the frontier between private firm and public industry. We must punish firms who trespass merely for dispossessing us, however much, for the moment, we might admire the goods and services they produce.</p>

It centered around <a href="https://x.com/EricLevitz/status/1847273289913090128">Levitz's claim</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Small biz is not inherently more desirable than large-scale enterprises. Economies of scale exist. Large firms pay better than small firms, and are also easier to regulate (with large chains, a spot check at one location can incentivize compliance at hundreds of locations while policing the practices of every individual small business is not logistically feasible).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A lot of different things are true. It is true that</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>Bigger businesses often (not always) treat workers better than "Mom &amp; Pop" firms can manage, especially in terms of benefits and flexibility.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>The state is capable of enacting useful social policy — workplace safety standards, accommodations of disability, antidiscrimination law, etc — through bigger firms in ways it cannot through very small firms.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>There are often <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8882.html">technical economies of scale</a> in production that very small firms cannot exploit. Societies that rely too heavily on very small firms can end up impoverished by low productivity.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These factors tilt in favor of "bigger business" and against "very small" or "Mom &amp; Pop" firms.</p>
    <p>But there are some benefits and advantages of very small firms:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>In some industries, economies of scale are modest, and much of the value produced at an industry level lies in diversity of output, which favors very small firms. Restaurants and cafés and microbreweries, spas and nail salons, retail boutiques, artists and musicians — all at least sometimes have these characteristics.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Very small firms create opportunities for agency in production, which some (though far from all) people really value. Many people are perfectly happy to trade obedience for a paycheck. Others bristle at toiling in the belly of a hierarchy, being told what to do. An economy too heavily weighted towards larger firms may leave too few opportunities for those who value this kind of agency.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Very small firms create opportunities for agency in consumption. A small customer's interactions with a large firm are typically characterized by <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adhesion_contract">contracts of adhesion</a>.</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; font-style: italic;">
       « These are the terms on which our product is offered, this is the price, click the checkbox to accept or else fuck off. »
      </div>
      <p>A small customer has a greater likelihood of negotiating bespoke terms with the proprietors of a very small firm than with agents of a bigger firm.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>"Relationships" can be valuable in commerce. A relationship exists when parties to repeated transactions sometimes accept a worse deal than they might find elsewhere, not out of laziness or inconvenience, but in well-grounded expectation that each party's occasional indulgences will be reciprocated. This serves as a form of mutual insurance. It may <em>ipso facto</em> enhance the perceived value of goods and services. Smaller customers may be capable of forming more reliable and resilient relationships with very small firms than with larger firms.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Many of the best bigger firms start as small firms. This is not always true: Investors with large pools of capital can spin-up big firms <em>de novo</em>. Big firms sometimes spin out other big firms. Nevertheless, small firms that grow big constitute an important source of new entrants in most industries. These firms may be especially important for innovation. Very small firms can experiment at modest risk, and then scale up practices that eventually improve whole industries. If an industry is inhospitable to very small firms, this source of innovation may be blocked.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The net effect of all this is that it's silly to argue over which is better. We should expect and want both kinds of firms. We should want a restaurant industry with a much larger fraction of "Mom and Pops" than an automobile industry. But even in a restaurant industry, we'll want some Chipotles and Panda Expresses. And even in an automobile industry we'll want some startups producing novel products by novel means at initially inefficient scale.</p>
    <p>The fact that entrepreneurs and customers value the kind of agency and relationships that very small firms enable means we should expect and want more "Mom and Pops" than a narrow focus on efficiency or regulability would predict.</p>
    <p>But overall, we should expect and want most industries to be dominated by bigger firms. Even in industries where economies of scale are only modest, the value of diversity tops usually out at a pretty low level as well. Those modest technical economies of scale, the <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8882.html">insurance economies of scale</a> that allow larger firms to treat employees better, plus susceptibility to regulation all tilt the balance toward larger firms.</p>
    <p>But how large? I keep using terms like "bigger" and "very small". How big?</p>
    <p>This is where the anti-trusters have the better of the argument. Almost always, all of the advantages of "bigger" firms are fully exploited once enterprises reach medium size. You don't need behemoths that dominate whole industries.</p>
    <p>The state has little trouble perceiving and taxing and regulating midsize firms. Midsize firms are fully subject to labor and safety and other regulations that "Mom &amp; Pops" would find unaffordable, and so are left exempt from. Midsize firms can tolerate worker flexibility (say time off for emergencies, or parenthood), because they are big enough to have alternate workers who can pick up the slack.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, for an economy the size of the United States, midsize firms are large enough to exploit technical economies of scale almost completely. Your friendly neighborhood monopolist will deny this — they will finance studies to snow you — but neverthless it is true. Yes, any firm fixed cost can be made smaller if amortized over a larger number of customers. But even in theory, the incremental benefit of new scale is ever diminishing, and becomes increasingly negligible. In practice, most "fixed costs" hit capacity limits by midsize scale, after which they become variable again. You can only sell so many cars before you have to build a new factory.</p>
    <p>What do I mean by midsize? It is best to talk in industry terms. Policy seeks to shape market structure, not churn out identical firms of the size the commissar deems optimal. Firm sizes will vary within industries, and reasonable firm sizes will vary by industry.</p>
    <p>But in rough numbers, for the US national market, I'd describe an industry as dominated by midsize firms if the top ten firms in the industry together account for no more than 75% of the market, each have at least 3% share, and no one firm accounts for more than 20%. It's an industry in which most customers have meaningful access to tens of viable competitors — not hundreds or thousands of tiny "Mom &amp; Pops", not the handful (less than ten) that has become the norm in most US industries. Midsize firms exploit technical and insurance economies of scale, are legible vehicles for socially valuable regulation, and compete with one another vigorously.</p>
    <p>When industries are composed of firms larger than midsize, when the top few firms account for most of the share, the result is oligopoly. Rather than being susceptible to regulation as Levitz suggests, the state finds itself dependent on dominant firms. Boeing, Intel, all the "systematically important financial institutions" are too big to regulate or prosecute, and too critical to be permitted to fail. Very large firms become <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/11/indirection-and-the-character-of-capitalism-part-ii/index.html">specialists in exploiting market and political power</a> rather than technical processes of production. They develop "efficiencies" in a financial sense, and come to see the preconditions of hard-to-measure "quality" or "innovation" as fat to be trimmed. They get away with it, because they (and perhaps a few other giants, who adopt the same "best practices") are the only game in town.</p>
    <p>It is true that while "Mom &amp; Pops" have a role, they are not a great way to organize the bulk of a modern economy. It is also true that firms durably larger than midsize — defined by the scale at which they bestride their industries — ought to have no role whatsoever in a well run economy. Any "natural monopolies" should be public, or put under effective public control by regulation.</p>
    <p>Some industries — in which economies of scale are modest, diversity is highly valued, and durable relationships between small customers and businesses are important — should be regulated in ways particularly friendly to "Mom &amp; Pops". But for most industries, the goal of policy should be to construct a regulatory environment that favors vigorously competing midsize firms, and smaller upstarts that seek to join or displace them.</p>

    <p>A while back I wrote that <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/21/two-parties-make-us-stupid/index.html">two parties make us stupid</a>.</p>
    <p>Effective public deliberation requires a neutral-ish population who can help adjudicate. For any matter of public concern, there should be a sizable group whose interest in the question flows only through a broad public interest, rather than from any parochial stake in the outcome.</p>
    <p>In a courtroom, we choose juries randomly, rather than letting the prosecution and the defense stand their own jurors. We understand that if we let each team hire six jurors, nearly every jury would be hung. There'd be little point in holding a trial. Partisan jurors would not base their verdicts primarily on good-faith evaluation of the evidence presented. They'd deliver the verdicts they were hired to deliver. If we want a defendant to be judged without prejudice on the basis of evidence presented at trial, we need neutral-ish jurors with little skin in the game.</p>
    <p>Similarly, if nearly the whole of the politically engaged public is segmented into two camps, each of whose members share an overriding interest in winning contests that enhance the power of their side, then there can be no arbiter on behalf of a broader public interest. In every matter of public controversy, one of the two camps will have adopted a position which the other will oppose. Partisans on each side will tend to support their own party's position, regardless of cases earnestly made by advocates and activists on the broader merits of the issue. Substantive public deliberation will be short-circuited.</p>
    <p>If members of the public are segmented into five or six different camps, a matter of public controversy may have entrenched advocates on one side or the other in some of the parties. But the issue may be orthogonal to the remaining parties' core allegiances. A multiparty system leaves room for neutral-ish adjudicators who serve as a good faith audience to public deliberation, who will constitute the "swing" vote when the question is decided in a legislature or referendum. A two-party system can pull this off only when it sustains a population keenly interested in public affairs, but with only weak factional identities — people who are politically engaged but routinely cross party lines. That is, the parties cannot be sharply polarized.</p>
    <p>Criminal justice is largely exempt from this dynamic. While the guilt or innocence of a shoplifter is, in a certain sense, a matter of public controversy, the direct interests at stake are so small as to render the matter effectively private. The accused has a direct interest. The victim may perceive a direct interest. But for most of the rest of us, our stake in the outcome is only that justice be done. Courts can call jurors, filter away those whom there is some reason to think prejudiced, and conduct something like a fair trial.</p>
    <p>This becomes more difficult, however, when the defendant is herself a public figure, particularly when the defendant is aligned or associated with a major political faction. In a sharply polarized two-party system, whenever a prominent figure of either party faces criminal charges brought by members of the opposing party, people strongly identified with the defendant's party will call the prosecution illegitimate and politically motivated. People associated with the prosecuting party will claim merely to be applying the law, without fear or favor.</p>
    <p>Who is right and who is wrong? Without a credibly neutral public to adjudicate, the question is not decidable. You may be absolutely sure that your view (and, coincidentally, your side's view) is correct on the merits. The other side will have alternative facts.</p>
    <p>In a sharply polarized, two-party system, there is simply no fixed point, no neutral vantage from which anyone persuasively judge. Except in cases so egregious that even copartisans concede a necessity, the question of whether a prosecution is invidiously political can find no <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6970.html">authoritative</a> answer. It becomes the macro analogue of a <em>he-said, she-said</em> controversy. You may have a strong view, and have your own deep understanding of the merits of the case. But then you would have that view, wouldn't you.</p>
    <p>Again, in a multiparty system, or in a system with only weak factional identification, a less interested public can serve as arbiter and decide these questions. They might be complicated and hard and fraught, but when the bulk of a public not strongly identified with either the prosecutor's nor the defendant's faction comes to a decision, that decision can stand. No decision will engender a consensus or become authoritative while the public remains sharply polarized into two camps. Convictions will not be durable, unless transfers of power are prevented and one faction rules in perpetuity.</p>
    <p>A system that, to a reasonable approximation, administers rule-of-law in cases involving ordinary people, but which cannot credibly impose criminal consequences on people who are famous and political and wealthy, is not rule-of-law at all. The fissures between the factions become the basis of, and a veil over, a deeper divide, between <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288">those whom the law protects but does not bind, and those who, the law binds but does not protect</a>.</p>
    <p>We can argue all we want over whether Trump or <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=146397">Elon Musk</a> deserve imprisonment. I think there are strong cases against them both. I would, wouldn't I? People on the other side are sure Joe is the <em>pater familias</em> of a "Biden Crime Family".</p>
    <p>I know I am right and they are wrong. They know the same. We're collectively so polarized and sorted there is no one who can serve as jury, no way to credibly adjudicate the question.</p>
    <p>If we want rule-of-law, we'll need electoral reform. Not so much because we'll elect different people, but because of the way elections, by structuring citizens into constituencies, organize society as a whole. We need an <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">electoral system</a> that segments us into multiple camps, not just two, so that on many public controversies, most of us will have no factional interest, and can adjudicate rather than advocate.</p>

    <p>What makes a sovereign state?</p>
    <p>First, there is a territory. The territory has inhabitants. The territory is governed by a state. The state is legitimate.</p>
    <p>What makes a state "legitimate"? I think there are two distinct but related criteria, which I'll call <em>internal</em> and <em>external</em> legitimacy. About a year ago, I <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/10/13/national-self-determination-is-a-vicious-idea/index.html">described</a> what I now think of as internal legitimacy:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Legitimacy sounds very subjective, almost populist. Is a state “legitimate” because the masses agree with it, because people like it? No. It’s nice when they do, maybe even helpful, but nice isn’t what we’re after.</p>
     <p>We measure the legitimacy of a state by whether those on its territory both conform to it and resort to it. When the state commands, in the civilized tone of some legal notice (the threat of violence echoing faintly from the pages), do citizens obey? Or do various factions succeed at resisting, ignoring, and defying its edicts? When residents enter into dispute, do they draw their own weapons, or make use of the state’s courts and legislatures and police? Legitimacy is revealed by how people behave, not by what they say they think.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>External legitimacy, I think, is even simpler. A state is <em>externally legitimate</em> if it has effective control over violence that projects outward from its borders. If there are marauders or militias that ravage neighboring territories without the state's direction and consent, then the state lacks external legitimacy.</p>
    <p>When a state lacks external legitimacy, neighboring states cannot rely upon negotiation to address threats to their interests or to their own legitimacy. Sovereignty is a status that derives from reciprocality among peers. A state that cannot direct or suppress violence from its borders — violations of the sovereignty of neighbors — is not a peer at all. If a state is incapable of respecting neighbors' sovereignty, the state commands no sovereignty for its neighbors to respect.</p>
    <p>Finally there is formal recognition. States, and interstate bodies like the United Nations, proclaim by various procedures their recognition that a sovereign state exists, and include those states in ceremonies and institutions reserved for peer sovereigns. The United Nations offers a seat in the General Assembly. Diplomats are dispatched to, and accepted from, the formally recognized state. Among most states, a consensus emerges to describe a community of widely recognized states, which includes most states.</p>
    <p>A fully sovereign state demands that all of these criteria are met. The state genuinely governs its territory, suppresses — or in war directs — any violence that might project from its borders, recognizes and is recognized by other, peer, sovereign states.</p>
    <p>Of course these criteria are never perfectly met. Every state includes some parties who prosecute disputes via freelance violence ("crime"), even somewhat institutionalized freelance violence ("organized crime"). No state can entirely prevent odd cases of residents traveling from its borders and pulling a gun or attempting some adventure or coup. Any given state may not be formally recognized by some one or few other states. None of these blemishes undo state sovereignty, as long as they are small, idiosyncratic, marginal. It's a judgment call, but it's not usually in practice a hard judgment call. We are usually able to distinguish weirdoes who commit random crimes from organized militias that consistently prepare for and perform violence beyond the capacity of the putative state to control.</p>
    <p>The excellent Samantha Hancox-Li <a href="https://www.liberalcurrents.com/the-bloody-river/">writes</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Human history is a river of blood. There is no justice for the numberless dead. Justice is for the living and the yet to be born. It is our responsibility to give not vengeance but peace to those who will come after us. The lesson of history is that it does not matter where you draw the lines on the map. What matters is what kind of society lies on each side of that line. Liberal democracy is the only thing yet discovered that offers a chance for climbing out of the bloody river. Until Palestinians and Israelis both choose liberal democracy, there will be no peace. I do not know how to get there. I only know it is where we must go.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Although I too prefer liberal democracy, I think Hancox-Li sets her ambitions too high, her requirements too stringently. We have had more peace in the world, remarkably, than can be explained by liberal democracy. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are not invading their neighbors, at least not when their neighbors are sovereign states by the three criteria above. (Yemen, in civil war or partial occupation by an Iranian proxy, has not met those criteria for some time.) Iraq in 1990 and Russia in 2014 are exceptions that prove the rule. Invasion of fully sovereign states by fully sovereign states are rare, big-fucking-deals that other sovereign states can be organized to oppose and reverse. Failure to organize and reverse, or at least severely punish, these <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/12/14/norms-mean-you-cant-pull-rank/index.html">norm violations</a> invites further catastrophe.</p>
    <p>For any sovereign state, a war whose battlefield will include its own territory is terrible. For autocrats as much as for democrats, it is the ultimate negative-sum game. Sovereign states can negotiate and be negotiated with. They can join alliances. Understandings between states can be meaningful and effective. Sovereign states act and can be deterred "rationally", whatever their form of government. After the paroxysms of the mid-20th Century, war between sovereign states became infrequent. We did in fact learn something.</p>
    <p>In the vast majority of cases, war comes when the criteria set out above are not met. Violence emerges when a government claims sovereignty over territories beyond its internal legitimacy, beyond its capacity to control external violence, or where the boundaries of the territory are not widely agreed.</p>
    <p>Neither Israel/Palestine nor Lebanon are sovereign states. It matters not a whit that they have seats at the UN or internationally recognized borders. It matters even less that Israel refers to itself, absurdly, as a liberal democracy. Israel/Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, post-Saddam Iraq, none of these meet the basic preconditions of sovereign states. So these places are riven by violence, internally among groups that do not recognize the same sovereigns, externally as no sovereign can credibly negotiate terms to suppress the projection of violence into neighboring territories.</p>
    <p>The United States, but also China, all the powers and places in the world that enjoy the fruits of peaceful modernity, share a core foreign policy interest in a Westphalian order, in a world organized into sovereign states that are legitimate internally and externally, and widely recognized with clearly demarcated borders. Sovereign states are frequently tempted to undermine the sovereignty of neighbors and rivals, but it's like burning carbon. In the long term, it can only make you better off if everybody else sustains globally the system that you are undermining locally.</p>
    <p>Supporting and reinforcing a Westphalian order is a relatively modest ask, compared to universalizing liberal democracy. It's a project the world's great powers and most states might agree upon. It <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9234.html">doesn't foreclose geopolitical competition</a>. The world remains a chessboard. But a chessboard has squares.</p>

    <p>Last Weekend <a href="https://x.com/modeledbehavior">Adam Ozimek</a> and the <a href="https://eig.org/">Economic Innovation Group</a> hosted an "Econtwitter IRL" meetup at <a href="https://www.decadeslancaster.com/">Decades</a> in Lancaster, PA, a wonderful venue Ozimek cofounded. I'm isolated these days. I am very grateful to Ozimek for bringing together an online community I really value but that usually feels distant.</p>
    <p>During that event, <a href="https://x.com/cardiffgarcia">Cardiff Garcia</a> did a fascinating interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman">Paul Krugman</a>, at the end of which <a href="https://x.com/TheStalwart">Joe Wiesenthal</a> asked a critical question. The United States, under Joe Biden, is embarking on an aggressive program of industrial policy even as it pursues increasingly vigorous antitrust enforcement. Aren't there tensions between these goals? Responding to an antitrust investigation of NVIDIA, Dylan Matthews <a href="https://x.com/ddayen/status/1831426752616525856">similarly asked</a>, "Here you have a tremendously successful national champion in a strategically critical industry. Is that exactly what you want[?]"</p>
    <p>It's a good question!</p>
    <p>South Korea, an industrial policy success story, famously elevated a small number of "chaebols", who dominate that economy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/business/chaebol-south-korea.html">to this day</a>. Japan's successful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry">MITI</a> gave the world automobile champions like Toyota and industrial conglomerates like Yamaha. Smaller countries may have no other choice than to endow national champions, boulders among pebbles in their domestic economies, in order to achieve <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8882.html">technical economies of scale</a> necessary to compete in world markets.</p>
    <p>But industrial policy often fails, and usually when it fails, it does so for simple reasons of political economy. All industrial policy requires that the state subsidize firms, one way or another. But successful industrial policy demands that states also force firms to compete, so the subsidy becomes invested in efficient production, rather than simply captured by shareholders. Here's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-26/vivek-chibber-on-what-it-takes-to-make-industrial-policy-succeed">Vivek Chibber</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>In country after country after country, you found [firms] hanging on to the subsidies and the general import-substitution long after everyone realized, ‘Look, we've reached about as far as we can go with the subsidy side, now we need to push these guys into competition.’ Long after they understood that, they stuck with a self-defeating policy.</p>
     <p>The question is, why? And the answer is political. Basically, it's this: what all the economists assumed was a government and a state that's essentially free...and powerful enough...to tell firms to do whatever it wants them to do, and they're going to step into line. But the fact is, in any modern industrial capitalist economy, these firms who you're trying to push into exports are also the people with the most political power, the most political influence. They have the lobbyists, they have all the money, they fund elections, and they run the economy.</p>
     <p>So here's the trap you were in. You gave them a bunch of free money and now you are asking to give up that free money and go into essentially shark infested waters. And country after country, what most of them said was, ‘Nah, we're not going to do it. Actually, we like it just the way it is.’ And, since we fund all the politicians, whoever gets into power, we're going to make sure they keep plowing this money towards us.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A national champion is at best a double-edged sword. It has the resources to become a world-class competitor, if those resources are allocated adroitly rather than captured as cash flow to shareholders. But those same resources enable it to <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/11/indirection-and-the-character-of-capitalism-part-ii/index.html">specialize in exploiting market and political power, rather than in any technical facet of production</a>.</p>
    <p>Without competition to inform and discipline a "champion" while it is an infant, competing mostly in domestic markets, often under tariff protection, it may have no way even to learn how to excel at world-class production. The skills required to buy the loyalty of politicians, on the other hand, are accessible, reliable, and widely distributed.</p>
    <p>The largest economy to succeed at industrial policy is China. What the <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/13/china-as-a-model/index.html">Chinese example</a> teaches is that, at least for large economies, there is no need to risk capture by national champions. Instead of targeting a few, particular firms for subsidy, one targets a competitive domestic industry, and funds a whole menagerie.</p>
    <p>In 2022, China's leading manufacturer of photovoltaic modules <a href="https://www.pvtime.org/top-10-chinese-module-suppliers-shipped-over-240gw-globally-in-2022/">produced</a> less than 16% of industry output. The top four manufacturers accounted for less than 60% of production. Brad Setser <a href="https://x.com/Brad_Setser/status/1837992271741882653">points out</a> that in China's "capex heavy steel sector…every province has its own local champion". China bestrides the planet like a colossus in both of these industries, but there are no national champions to be found.</p>
    <p>China's experience suggests one can use the conditions of funding to affirmatively structure the market in ways that ensure continuing competition, rather than rely solely on after the fact policing by antitrust authorities. China's subsidies come via provincial governments, whose officials require their champions remain local. In the US, firms might simply be forbidden contractually from selling equity or assets to rivals or roll-ups.</p>
    <p>However protected the domestic players might be from more advanced foreign competitors, competition in the domestic economy generates innovation and know-how. Despite subsidy, no domestic firm can rest on its laurels.</p>
    <p>As competition brings the quality and efficiency of production towards world-market standards, it becomes politically plausible to reduce trade barriers, placing the now adolescent industry in global competition. Reducing tariffs won't destroy jobs at firms that produce competitively. Firms confident they can compete often lobby <em>for</em> open borders, because they gain access to a much larger global market by ceding some access to their own smaller pond.</p>
    <p>So, for larger economies, there is no tension between industrial policy and antitrust. On the contrary, they are essential complements. Successful industrial policy requires that subsidized domestic firms vigorously compete.</p>
    <p>National champions are a bad idea. Like athletic champions, they inevitably grow old. A vibrant capitalism (like a vibrant political system) depends on older incumbents ceding dominance to upstarts. Productivity growth is a process of small increments as stalwart firms iterate, but also great leaps as dissidents <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ftc-chair-lina-khan-wants-to-keep-fighting-non-competes-60-minutes/">jump ship from staid incumbents</a> and recombine industry know-how in novel, creative, threatening ways. National champions interfere with this process. They prove capable at discouraging rivals. They defend their turf, until their inevitable collapse — this too must pass — means collapse of a whole nation's industry, rather than a passing of the baton.</p>
    <p>We require industrial policy. But we should eschew, even dismantle, "national champions".</p>

    <p>Ezra Klein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/opinion/supply-side-progressivism.html#">called it</a> "supply-side progressivism". Derek Thompson <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/">called for</a> an "abundance agenda".</p>
    <p>If you hold liberal, progressive values and you want a better world, your project will be much easier when the economy is objectively delivering for people and opening up possibilities, rather than when politics seems like a zero-sum game and we are fighting to divide an inadequate pie.</p>
    <p>I agree with Klein and Thompson, and applaud the impulse. Abundance is good <em>per se</em>, and it is also good for us in moral terms. Fascism <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/08/14/fascism-as-triage/index.html">subsists off of scarcity</a>. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html">atrocities</a> it demands are justifiable to human beings of ordinary virtue only as a matter of grim necessity, because it is us or them.</p>
    <p>Klein and Thompson offer a variety of ideas about why abundance seems to elude us. There's a lot of emphasis on ways that public policy can hinder abundance. Permitting barriers thwart new housing and infrastructure. We sabotage industrial policy with "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/opinion/democrats-liberalism.html">everything bagel</a>" demands, asking firms we subsidize to offer union jobs and child care and other goods that, however laudable, are costly, and may undermine the core goal of building capable, competitive industries.</p>
    <p>Promoting an "abundance faction", <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-rise-of-the-abundance-faction/">Robert Saldin and Steven Teles</a> write</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The state that America built in the 1960s and 1970s was, at its heart, regulative. From civil rights to environmental protection, its animating obsessions were things that it wanted to&nbsp;<em>prevent</em>&nbsp;from happening, such as racial and gender discrimination, nuclear disasters, highways through central cities, industrial accidents, dangerous toys, and environmental pollution. While much of this regulation was geared to private action, a great deal of it came to apply to the public sector as well. From the creation of compliance divisions inside of firms to the expansion of standing to sue to rules on public participation in government decision-making, the state that we created a half-century ago had the effect of displacing or slowing down the parts of organizations — public and private — focused on the delivery of goods and services. The aggregate effect of that state has been a widely diffused expectation that more or less everything that operates in physical space will take an extraordinary and unpredictable amount of time and be disappointing and uninspiring in its results.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>All of these authors make excellent points, some of which withstand criticism, some of which I think do not.</p>
    <p>But it is a bit dispiriting, 40+ years after the election of Ronald Reagan, that so often the explanation for Amerisclerosis boils down to "deregulation has never really been tried."</p>
    <p>Really? If the Reagan revolution and its enthusiastic embrace by Democrats and Republicans under Clinton, Obama, and both Bush administrations were not sufficient to make deregulation great, is it plausible that a new deregulatory "abundance faction" is the best way forward?</p>
    <p>Perhaps these ideas that first came into vogue in the late 1970s do not capture the whole story. Perhaps it is not, or not just, the public sector that thwarts the great abundance machine of American capitalism. Perhaps the machine is flawed. It thwarts itself. Perhaps its very design incorporates elements that promote scarcity rather than abundance.</p>
    <p>If so, if we can understand how, we could tinker with that design, and fix the problem. We needn't overthrow capitalism, or socialize the means of production. There are many possible capitalisms. We could choose a better version.</p>
    <p>Under capitalism, a firm can achieve pricing power — the ability to raise prices without losing customers — in a variety of different ways. It can produce at higher quality than its rivals, for example.</p>
    <p>But how do <em>whole industries</em> achieve pricing power? If an excellent firm can command higher prices by virtue of quality, what defines the baseline price the firm gets to exceed?</p>
    <p>In competitive industries with only variable costs, the cost of inputs provides a floor. But in industries that require expensive fixed capital, especially highly competitive industries, firms must tacitly coordinate.</p>
    <p>They coordinate not to control prices, nor to restrict output that their factories could produce, but simply not to build so many factories. If there are too many factories — "overcapacity" in the lingo — competition will bring prices below what producers require to recover the cost of building the factories in the first place. This phenomenon of firms tacitly coordinating to limit total industry capacity has a name, "<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/capital-discipline-raises-questions-about-us-oilfield-services/">capital discipline</a>".</p>
    <p>Is "capital discipline" illegal? I don't know. I suspect it'd be hard to punish. It's one thing to prosecute a monopolist for refusing to produce at capacity, preferring to raise prices. It's quite another to prosecute a firm in a competitive industry for choosing not to invest, for not building a new factory, because the firm fears that if it does add capacity, prices might drop below what would allow it to recoup its costs. Prosecuting that seems like a stretch, even if the firm's existing factories are running flat-out and its goods are selling profitably.</p>
    <p>Further, under our current capitalism, whether or not it is legal, capital discipline is <em>necessary</em>. Except in extraordinary circumstances, we expect firms to thrive or die on their own revenues, with no state subsidy. Yet firms are also supposed to compete vigorously and let price approach marginal cost. In high fixed-cost industries, the only way to reconcile these two admonitions is to ensure that capacity is constrained at an industry level. If we had an antitrust so stringent that it prosecuted capital discipline, every firm in every high-fixed-cost industry would go bust.</p>
    <p>You often hear business commentators opine that an industry "needs to consolidate", for "efficiency". If you ask, those commentators will usually say it's because there are <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8882.html">technical economies of scale</a> that smaller firms cannot fully exploit.</p>
    <p>But technical economies of scale exhaust themselves long before the degree of consolidation that is common and considered "efficient" in the contemporary United States. What people really mean by "efficient consolidation" is an industry sufficiently consolidated that its firms, competing vigorously, can survive full business cycles without going bust for failing to cover their high fixed costs. Efficiency, in this sense, is managed scarcity.</p>
    <p>You can see, then, that there might be some tension between <em>this version</em> of capitalism and an abundance agenda. So long as the economy we imagine is one in which unaided, purely private firms are expected both to vigorously compete and to survive, then high-capital industries must engineer scarce capacity.</p>
    <p>Yes, yes, those bastards. Perhaps they overengineer scarce capacity. They do have shareholders to please, executives to enrich.</p>
    <p>But even if they did not, even if firms' goal was to just barely recoup fixed costs, they would have to engineer scarce capacity. Then we wonder why this great machine of American capitalism fails to yield "abundance".</p>
    <p>What do we even mean by "abundance"?</p>
    <p>We don't mean "glut". Glut is when firms produce more goods than customers will buy, and see them collect dust as inventory. That's not what we're after. Sure, for some critical goods, we might want a buffer stock. But then we'd pay to buy and store the goods, like the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
    <p>I'd posit that when we ask for abundance, what we want is <em>inexpensive price elastic supply</em>. We don't want more goods produced than are demanded for purchase. But we do want new demand to be accommodated with an expansion of quantity, rather than rationed with an increase in price. We don't want excess goods. We want spare, slack, production capacity.</p>
    <p>In other words, we want the resting state of American industry <em>not</em> to be just enough capacity, efficiently used. We want excess capacity, inefficiently unused. The cost of this "inefficiency" is overcome by a benefit both private and social — the ability of firms to ramp up production at stable prices should conditions change.</p>
    <p>The core of an abundance agenda, I posit, would be to reshape American capitalism so that <em>overcapacity</em>, rather than capacity nearly fully employed, becomes the norm. At desirable overcapacity, the marginal cost of a new unit would sit approximately at the minimum of firms' marginal cost schedule, well below the level where costs meaningfully rise.</p>
    <p>Firms can't do this on their own. Under capitalism, the means of production are in private hands, but production is always a public-private partnership. That firms use public roads and rely upon public regulation does not render our economy socialist.</p>
    <p>An abundance economy should rely upon private firms competing aggressively, pursuing pricing power through quality and innovation, rather than by engineering scarcity. But if we want industries to eschew capital discipline, if we want firms to deploy capacity at levels that would undo the pricing power scarce capacity yields, the public sector will have to subsidize capital deployment.</p>
    <p>The public sector should <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/09/04/income-driven-repayment-of-fixed-capital/index.html">do just that</a>.</p>

    <p>I don't think a sovereign wealth fund is a thing one can intelligently be "for" or "against", generically. That's like being asked to take a position on chlorine. I'm against chlorine if the proposal is I should breathe it. I'm for chlorine as part of a water purification process. You really do need to be more specific. There are versions of social wealth funds that I'd oppose, others about which I'd be enthusiastic. I did <a href="https://t.co/GIs4TKGnV8">a talk</a> on the subject several years ago, if you have an hour to kill.</p>
    <p>I think people focus too much on the asset and benefits side of social wealth fund proposals, and too little on the effects of how the funds might be financed. In an American context, much of the reason to want a social wealth fund is to divert financial flows from where they would otherwise go.</p>
    <p>For example, here's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-10/us-sovereign-wealth-fund-wouldn-t-be-like-norway-s-or-singapore-s">Tyler Cowen</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>It is true that the expected rate of return of the US stock market is&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.is/o/1kax3/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_premium_puzzle">higher</a>&nbsp;than the US government’s borrowing rate. But what matters is the&nbsp;<em>net</em>&nbsp;social increase in investment value, not the nominal returns on the government’s portfolio. If the government buys some of my mutual funds, for instance, and it earns the 7% return that I would otherwise have earned, there is no net increase in social value. On paper, the sovereign wealth fund looks like a big success, but the government has simply issued more debt and redistributed some equity returns away from the citizenry and toward itself.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Cowen elides questions of distribution. Who is this "citizenry"? To whom do equity returns actually go?</p>
    <p>While much of the public owns some shares, fully the majority of US stock market wealth, in dollar terms, is <a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/stock-ownership-concentration/">owned</a> by the richest 1%. Only 7% is owned by the bottom 90%.</p>
    <p>The government <span style="white-space: nowrap">"[r]edistribut[ing]</span> equity returns from the citizenry and toward itself" has another name. It's called a tax. It's a tax that falls almost entirely on the rich, but is experienced painlessly, in the form of returns foregone relative to a counterfactual. The rich find themselves with just a bit less opportunity to get richer.</p>
    <p>I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6987.html">wrote about</a> precisely the phenomenon Cowen describes in 2018:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>A sovereign — er, social — wealth fund is a&nbsp;<em>taxation machine</em>. It is an automatic taxation monster. It takes the miracle of compound growth that capitalists are always on about and turns it into a miracle of compound taxation, effectively taxing wealthier cohorts (those who would otherwise own the SWF assets) an ever increasing share of income year after year without requiring any new legislation, and with minimal distortion of investment behavior.</p>
     <p>To see how this works, let’s imagine that we want to simulate the flows of an SWF+UBD. We’ll imagine a very simple scenario. Let’s define a “notional” SWF. The SWF is going to be financed by a tax enacted just once, which will yield $1T in Year 0. The tax take will grow with nominal GDP, which we will model as growing at 5% annually. Beginning at the end of Year 1, the SWF will make payouts. For simplicity, we will base payouts and returns on the end-of-prior-year balance. That is, we are conservatively assuming that the taxes we collect within a year are unavailable until the year following. We will assume a constant rate of investment return of 8% per year. Echoing Bruenig’s proposal, we will have the SWF payout 4% of the prior year balance each year.</p>
     <p>However, instead of actually forming the SWF, let’s say that the government were to decide that there’s no need to intervene in the miraculous private sector with actual&nbsp;<em>state ownership</em>, that the assets can remain, um, efficiently managed in private hands but the government will simply use the tax system to reproduce the flows an SWF would generate. As it would if it actually formed the SWF, in Year 0 it would enact a tax, which would raise $1T. At the end of Year 1, it would have raised an additional $1.05T from the same tax. The notional SWF would have enjoyed the same $1.05T as new contribution. However, the notional SWF, if it had actually been constituted, would have also earned $0.08T as investment returns. In order to simulate the SWF flows, the state would have had to adopt a new capital tax of $80B. In Year 2, we have the same effect again. The originally enacted tax now raises $1.1025T, and the new Year 1 tax brings in $84B (assuming that both grow in line with GDP), for a total intake of $1.1865T. However, investment returns on the prior year SWF balance of $2.09T would have yielded $167.2B, which when added to the same take of $1.1025T from the initial tax, yields an inflow of $1.2697T. So, to bring the total inflows in line with what an SWF would have done automatically, the government would have to impose a new tax of $83.2B.</p>
     <p>And so on. Each year, to reproduce the same net flows from private capital holders as would “naturally” have occurred had there been a SWF, the state would have to enact a brand new tax, in addition to still collecting the taxes enacted in prior years. Under our assumptions, each year’s new tax is slightly smaller as a share of GDP than the prior year’s, but in reality, that would depend upon investment returns, gdp, and dividend payouts. Whenever investment returns net of dividend payouts exceed GDP growth, the effective new tax that would need to be imposed on capital holders becomes larger as a share of GDP than the prior year’s tax. (Here’s the little&nbsp;<em>Mathematica</em>&nbsp;simulation the numbers in this section are drawn from: [<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2018/09/sim-swf.pdf">pdf</a>][<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2018/09/sim-swf.nb">nb</a>])</p>
     <p>We can all, as Mike Konczal&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/rortybomb/status/1034597314864795657">put it on Twitter</a>, “spitball” about politics. But I think it fair to say that it would be difficult to sustain the political will to cumulatively impose new taxes on capital holders, every year, year after year after year over a period that might span decades. But the “gimmick” of actually using the proceeds from a single tax, enacted once and continued indefinitely, to purchase capital assets, generates the same effect as this compounding tax schedule in a way that seems natural and inevitable and legitimate under the norms of present-day capitalism. If we accept that other capital holders get to enjoy the miracle of compound returns, why shouldn’t a fund owned in equal shares by all citizens get to enjoy the same? Actually constituting a SWF delivers a regime of effective taxation that, I think it is fair to say, ordinary politics simply could not.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If you think it is a good thing to let the "miracle of compound growth" cumulate endlessly in wealthy private hands — creating permanent, ever-expanding gaps between the rich and the less rich, entrenching a system of wealth-stratified caste — then yes, you should oppose the state <span style="white-space: nowrap">"[r]edistribut[ing]</span> equity returns from the citizenry and toward itself".</p>
    <p>If, however, you think letting compound growth continually expand the advantage of the already wealthy is not great, if you dislike living in a society whose economic, political, and cultural life is increasingly <a href="https://zirk.us/@interfluidity/113117432692163672">vandalized and held for ransom by mad billionaires</a>, then perhaps it would desirable to divert equity returns away from "the citizenry" and towards purposes whose benefits will be much more widely shared.</p>
    <p>The state, of course, is corrupt as fuck. But in its worst corruption, nothing that the state does at scale results in benefits as lopsidedly plutocratic as the dollar distribution of investment returns when they compound in private hands.</p>
    <hr>
    <div style="font-size: smaller;">
     <p><strong>Update 2024-09-13:</strong> For the record, I would not support a social wealth fund that was financed by the state issuing debt or money to buy up stock in ordinary times, despite the (fragile unless state-supported) claim that "the expected rate of return of the US stock market is&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.is/o/1kax3/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_premium_puzzle">higher</a> than the US government’s borrowing rate". That would create windfall profits for the bloated and parasitic finance sector, and it would give back some of its distributional benefits by bidding up the price of equities which, for the forseeable future, would remain primarily in the hands of the privately rich.</p>
     <p>I would support an equity-holding social wealth fund financed from progressive new taxation. Taxes that kick in only at high income brackets divert flows that would otherwise have been devoted almost entirely to purchasing portfolio assets. A social wealth fund financed with such flows thus represents a rotation of demand for these assets from the private to the public sector, rather than a new bid that would accelerate increases in the price or rate of issuance of financial assets.</p>
     <p>Under rare circumstances, I might support debt-financed purchase of securities into an SWF, at collapsed prices and excellent forward-looking valuations, as a component of macrostability interventions. There are always devils in details, but here there are also devils in suits, Wall-Streeters who'd love to use the Federal government as a gigantic source of dumb money, to earn commisions from, and to offload crap to. Overall I treat suggestions to use new debt issuance rather than taxation of private-sector financial asset purchasers very cautiously.</p>

    <p>High-fixed-cost industries are <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/24/competition-and-the-form-of-the-subsidy/index.html">difficult to reconcile</a> with competitive capitalism. Under competition, price falls toward marginal cost, which excludes the cost of fixed capital. Firms earn at least the incremental cost of producing an additional unit, but they don't recoup the cost of building the factory that made it possible, absent some form of pricing power.</p>
    <p>In introductory economics textbooks, pricing power is imagined to result from firms exiting the market until industrywide capacity constraints bring marginal cost above average variable costs. For industries whose fixed costs derive from durable capital, this story <a href="https://jwmason.org/slackwire/in-praise-of-profiteering/">doesn't actually work</a>, because built capital survives firm exit and remains exploitable by new (or bankruptcy-reorganized) firms.</p>
    <p>Industry pricing power derived from limited capacity is also just undesirable. It leaves society without the option to expand production quickly when circumstances or preferences shift, like after a pandemic.</p>
    <p>In an uncertain world, option value is real value. We want our industries in a state of "overcapacity", so they inexpensively expand production when demand increases, rather than price-ration constrained supply.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, our collective, social interest is quite opposite firms' private interests. The invisible hand gives us the finger.</p>
    <p>Social option value derives from our economy's capacity to expand quantities produced, with minimal price increases, under unexpected demand. But to firms, "excess" capacity is a cost. Should demand spike, producers profit more if constrained capacity forces price rationing and high markups rather than elastic new supply. Firms gain private option value precisely by destroying social option value.</p>
    <p>So, industries will coordinate and consolidate to prevent overcapacity, if we tolerate it. Their pricing power — both under baseline conditions and during demand spikes — becomes the public's cost. If they gain pricing power in excess of what is necessary to cover the cost of fixed capital, the result is rent extraction by producers and deadweight loss from demanded goods never supplied. For important goods — products that might become necessary promptly in the event of a public health emergency or (God forbid) a military conflict — the deadweight cost of constrained capacity might be existential.</p>
    <p>It is efficient, then, to subsidize capacity and the social option it creates, rather than to subsidize incapacity by tolerating industry consolidation and pricing power.</p>
    <p>But how?</p>
    <p>I propose we offer the subsidy, <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">as China does</a>, in the form of underpriced finance. Like in China, our subsidy should take a form that overcomes the incompatibility between high-fixed-cost industries and vigorous competition. Our high-fixed-cost industries should have tens of competing firms, rather than collapse into "Big 3" oligopolies with pricing power and negative social option value.</p>
    <p>Unlike China, I propose we offer this underpriced finance openly, via transparent instruments whose embedded subsidy we all understand and acknowledge. Here's how it would work.</p>
    <p>In strategic industries, firms would be able to petition the state for loans to build production capital. But rather than have a fixed repayment schedule, <em>the payment due over any time period would be a function of the number of units sold</em>.</p>
    <p>Should goods sell briskly, firms might fully repay the loan, including interest at the agreed rate. Should goods sell slowly, the firm might never fully repay the loan. When a pre-agreed depreciable life of the purchased capital expires, any unpaid balance on the loan would be forgiven. Firms would be required to produce and offer goods for sale for the full depreciable life of the capital in order to enjoy loan forgiveness.</p>
    <p>The effect of this proposal is to eliminate fixed capital costs, and instead convert them to marginal costs.</p>
    <p>Note this is quite different from, say, renting capital goods, or using ordinary borrowing to finance them. These traditional approaches help space out the burden of capital costs. But those costs are still invariant to later production choices. Firms have to make payments regardless of whether they sell. If firms have excess capacity, they benefit relative to not selling if they produce and then sell for just over marginal cost, even if that price cannot cover the cost of fixed capital.</p>
    <p>Under the proposed new instrument, firms only have to pay the capital cost allocated to a given unit if and when they actually sell the unit. Capital costs are not invariant to their production choices. Firms only produce and sell when their anticipated sales price covers not only the marginal production cost, but also the capital repayment burden they incur only with the sale.</p>
    <p>This reasoning would be mistaken if the repayment burden was so high, relative to expected sales, that firms would end up repaying the loan in full with near certainty. If that were the case, there'd be no subsidy in the loan (assuming a market interest rate). It would be something like a bank line-of-credit with less discretionary repayment terms.</p>
    <p>But the point of this proposal is to finance capital goods <em>beyond</em> the level that industries would otherwise privately choose to invest. The full repayment point would be set at a level that could be achieved only with a pace of sales substantially brisker than a typical firm would anticipate — even with prices aggressively disciplined by competitors — under baseline demand conditions. At an industry level, the state would offer these vehicles to many contending firms, under terms where the average firm would not quite fully repay them. So, for most firms, repayment avoided from eschewing an underpriced sale becomes a genuine economic gain, not a mere rejiggering of the timing of payments.</p>
    <p>Firms would retain incentive to compete on quality, even as the competitive environment renders them very close to price-takers. The highest quality firms would sell to their full capacity, and so <em>would</em> fully repay their loans, and then enjoy pricing power set by the increment in marginal cost these repayments impose upon more typical firms. Selling past the full repayment threshold converts part of the industry price to economic profit above and beyond covering the cost of fixed capital. For a relatively few big winners, the market awards a trophy even though the state provides no subsidy.</p>
    <p>More typical firms, the firms that are not big winners, do not go bankrupt. They do not exit. They survive, earning ordinary accounting profit, near-zero economic profit, providing spare capacity. They become institutional embodiments of social option value, for whose survival the state pays a premium — the portion of the loan that will ultimately be forgiven.</p>
    <p>It may be desirable, as a matter of market discipline, to arrange that the lowest quality producers do in fact go bankrupt and exit. We can get this effect by funding fixed capital with a mix of our "income-driven repayment" vehicle and traditional amortizing loans. Holding constant the aggregate capital financed and the number of firms, the more we use amortizing loans, the more market discipline we impose, but the less capacity we endow in expectation. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/09/04/income-driven-repayment-of-fixed-capital/#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>To emphasize, this new financing vehicle is not intended as a firm-level arrangement. It is intended to be provided at the level of <em>industries</em> that we consider strategic, for which there is important social option value in maintaining competitive domestic capacity. We would provide it to tens of firms in industries we target, not to one or two favored incumbents.</p>
    <p>I have <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/13/china-as-a-model/index.html">recently argued</a> that we should learn from China's economic model, but adapt it to Western institutions and values. This proposal represents a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/24/competition-and-the-form-of-the-subsidy/index.html">means of providing the subsidy</a> at the heart of that model — payment of the premium on valuable social options.</p>
    <p>But our mechanism is open and straightforward. It does not rely upon loans that become overvalued on effectively fraudulent balance sheets of banks and local government financing vehicles.</p>
    <p>"Income-driven repayment of fixed capital" would constitute a transparent means of providing subsidized finance to strategic industries in a manner that encourages competition, capacity, and quality.</p>

      <li id="fn-1">
       <p>Given the low expected profitability of typical firms, the share of any amortizing loans in the financing mix should be low, if we intend for Mistress Market to cull only the worst perfomers. All of these loans would be secured by the capital goods purchased. Failed firms would surrender the capital goods back to the state, which would not offer them cheaply to new entrants, but either scrap them or offer them to new firms on comparable repayment terms, in order to maintain cost parity and the terms of competition established.</p><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/09/04/income-driven-repayment-of-fixed-capital/#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li>

    <p>"No Tax On Tips" is intended to help lower-income service workers — waiters and bartenders, perhaps manicurists and hairstylists — not, say, hedge fund managers who are arguably also in a "service" occupation. Yet, in the discussions I've encountered, the presumption is the "tax" referred to is the income tax.</p>
    <p>But that's idiotic! Low-end tipped workers pay far more tax on their tips as <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751">FICA taxes</a> — the employee portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes — than they do as income taxes. If the intention is to help low-end service workers, we should interpret the pledge as referring to Federal payroll taxes, rather than the income tax. This would not be welching on the promise candidates have made. It would fulfill the promise more completely, by offering more relief to the groups targeted than income tax relief would.</p>
    <p>A "no FICA tax on tips" pledge does not entirely prevent gaming to avoid the tax. But, when combined with occupational limitations and penalties for fraudulent claims, it will prevent nearly all gaming of the proposal by higher income earners. At higher incomes, the vast majority of ones Federal tax burden is the income tax. The higher ones income, the lower the relative burden of the payroll taxes. High income people won't risk criminal liability for fraud to evade a small fraction of the taxes they face.</p>
    <p>If the employee-side FICA tax on tips were simply eliminated, that would harm the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and reduce the benefits tipped workers could expect to receive. Fortunately, we've already addressed this problem on the employer-side, so we know what to do.</p>
    <p>There is already a FICA <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/tax-break-down-fica-tip-credit">Tip</a> <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/FICA-Tip-Credit.pdf">Credit</a> that food-service employers can claim against the FICA taxes they pay on tips. (The credit was enacted as a means of increasing employers' motivation to ensure that tip income is reported.) The FICA Tip Credit is an income tax credit, granted after contributions have already been mad to the trust fund. So it does not affect trust fund contributions.</p>
    <p>Suppose we do the following:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>Leave tips notionally taxable as they are.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Enact a refundable, employee-side FICA Tip Credit for the full amount of Federal payroll taxes due on applicable tips.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>As we did with the expanded Child Tax Credit, have the IRS remit payments of the tax credit monthly. Funds would be disbursed directly to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, on each employee's behalf.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Do not withhold FICA taxes from tips.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Pay stubs would show total Social Security and Medicare taxes due, then the credit for FICA taxes on tips, reducing the total withheld.</p>
    <p>Tipped employers would get paid the full value of their tips, without any Federal payroll tax deducted. If their incomes are high enough to be subject to income tax withholding, they would still suffer that. But that's small potatoes for lower income workers.</p>
    <p>Overall, lower income workers would enjoy much bigger paychecks than they would have under a "no income tax on tips" interpretation.</p>
    <p>Workers would experience no penalty in terms of future Social Security and Medicare benefits from the program.</p>
    <p>And it just wouldn't be worth it for high-income workers to try to fashion themselves cosmetolologists for a small tax benefit and large risk of jail time.</p>

    <p>The virtues of a market economy derive largely from competition. But for many goods and services, it is almost incoherent to talk about competitive provision.</p>
    <p>As J. W. Mason <a href="https://jwmason.org/slackwire/in-praise-of-profiteering/">explains</a> (ht <a href="https://wealtheconomics.substack.com/">Steve Roth</a>):</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The usual situation in a modern economy...is flat or declining marginal costs. Non-increasing marginal costs, nonzero fixed costs, and competitive pricing cannot coexist: In the absence of increasing marginal costs, a price equal to marginal cost leaves nothing to cover fixed costs. Modern industries, which invariably involve substantial fixed costs and flat or declining marginal costs at normal levels of output, require some degree of monopoly power in order to survive. This is the economic logic behind patents and copyrights — developing a new idea is costly, but disseminating it is cheap. So if we are relying on private businesses for this, they must be granted some degree of monopoly.</p>
     <p>The problem is, once we agree that some degree of market power is necessary in order for industries without declining returns to cover their fixed costs, how do we know how much market power is enough? Too much market power, and firms can make super-normal profits by holding prices above the level required to cover their costs, reducing access to whatever social useful thing they supply. Too little market power, and competing firms will be inefficiently small, drive each other to bankruptcy, or simply decline to enter, depriving society of the useful thing entirely. Returning to the IP example: To the extent that copyrights and patents serve an economic function, it is possible for them to be either too long or too short.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>One way or another, the answer to this conundrum of high fixed costs, low variable costs, is and always has been state subsidy.</p>
    <p>What are copyrights and patents, really? Here's <a href="https://cepr.net/debts-deficits-and-patent-monopolies/">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>At the most basic level, we have to understand that patent (and copyright) monopolies are a way the government pays for things it wants. Instead of using government funds to pay drug companies to develop new drugs and vaccines, we reward them with a patent monopoly...</p>
     <p>In the government’s accounting, we treat patent monopolies and spending very differently. The grant of a patent monopoly does not appear in the government’s budget, so we can award these monopolies as an alternative to direct spending if we want the deficit to appear smaller.</p>
     <p>We sometimes have literally gone this route of using a patent monopoly, or an equivalent grant of exclusivity, as a substitute to direct spending. In the case of prescription drugs, in order to get drug companies to do pediatric trials, the government will award a company a six-month period of exclusivity, beyond any patent duration, in order to pay for the trial.&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The government could just pay the money directly for the pediatric trial, but this would be a direct expenditure that adds to the deficit. If instead it adds six months to a patent, the company is paid by being able to charge higher drug prices for this period. In effect, the government is allowing the company to tax patients to cover the cost of the trial...</p>
     <p>The idea of selling the ability to tax is not new. Centuries ago, it was common for governments to do&nbsp;<a href="https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Tax+Farming">tax farming</a>, which effectively meant that it sold the right to impose a certain tax for a set period of time.</p>
     <p>Suppose the government sold off the right to collect the estate tax for the next two decades for $1 trillion. The deficit hawks could all be very happy because our debt would now be $1 trillion lower, but anyone capable of logical thought would see that this has not relieved the burden of the debt on our children one iota.</p>
     <p>It is the same story with patent rents.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And it's not just patents and copyrights.</p>
    <p>The state could in principle operate a comprehensive and vigorous antitrust regime. In practice, the state purposefully tolerates varying degrees of consolidation in many industries. Why?</p>
    <p>Corruption? Capture? Of course that's part of it.</p>
    <p>But there is also the true fact, which policymakers do understand, that insisting on Econ-101-style "perfect competition" for high-fixed-cost industries can be a prescription for not having those industries at all. The pricing power regulators tolerate, the consolidation they even <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1997-book2/html/PPP-1997-book2-doc-pg993.htm">encourage</a>, amounts to a state-granted license to impose an excise tax on consumers, just like patents.</p>
    <p>Just like patents, this might be a good thing. If our counterfactual will be perfect competition, foreseeable failure to recoup costs might prevent these industries from existing at all. But just like patents, we have a hard time evaluating whether this taxing power that we are so tacitly and indirectly granting is too little, leaving valuable activity underfinanced, or too much, and then a license for predation and extraction.</p>
    <p>Patents, copyrights, and tolerated market power are all means of subsidizing activities that could not thrive or even survive under Econ-101 perfect competition. But the function of competition is not only low prices. We want firms to vigorously compete because competition drives quality and innovation.</p>
    <p>High fixed-cost, low-variable-cost industries require some form of subsidy to survive. Both in the West and in <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">China</a>, governments have hit upon politically convenient, off-balance-sheet forms of subsidy. When the government is going to give somebody a sweetheart deal, it is preferable, from the perspective both of government officials and of recipients, if those sweetheart deals are hidden, deniable, <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo12244559.html">submerged</a>. This might not, however, be preferable from the perspective of the general public! And it damages our forward-looking capacity for policymaking, because we end up underestimating the costs of current practices when we evaluate "expensive" proposed reforms.</p>
    <p>China's tacit subsidies take the form of badly underpriced loans, which state-backed banks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_financing_vehicle">local government financing vehicles</a> pretend are good long after they are not, as well as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426621001230">government-directed venture capital</a>. Subsidy gets smuggled through losses that nobody will recognize for a long time. This form of tacit subsidy has advantages over Western practices of tolerating insulation from competition and granting limited monopolies. The Chinese approach preserves the non-price benefits of competition. It leaves in place ruthless competition for share in vigorously contested industries. Firms compete on quality, and they compete to innovate, even though before long they are all basically price-takers. China finances its industry contestants like it finances its Olympic contestants. The state pays up to cover the costs of bringing them into the arena.</p>
    <p>In the West we subsidize too, but the <em>form</em> of our subsidy deprives our industries of the benefit of vigorous competition. Our firms become complacent, less innovative, less careful to insure the very highest product quality.</p>
    <p>I don't propose that we adopt China's approach to subsidizing high-fixed-cost, low-variable-cost industries. China's cautious and opaque political system can work out its bad loans with quiet bailouts to keep banks and local governments above water, and with discretionary "corruption" prosecutions, to ensure local officials compete not to be the lossiest within a cohort of investments that should be expected, on average, to make losses. If we tried China's approach in the West, we would have massive scandals over every failed loan and bitter fights about the injustice of the bailouts.</p>
    <p>What I do propose is that we in the West acknowledge that our great industries are in fact subsidized, that they are not and they cannot be pure "free market" success stories. We should work consciously, intentionally, to develop <em>new forms of subsidy</em> consistent both with very vibrant competition and our more transparent political life.</p>
    <p>We should move away from grants of monopoly power, whether tacit acceptance of consolidation, or overt enforcement of patent and copyright. Those tools do important work, but they have terrible side effects. We can do better.</p>

    <p>Price regulation is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-price-gouging-ban-inflation-65dc8844bb41159d76886f752b6cab28">in the ether</a>. I find the "debate", such as it is, stupid.

Badly crafted or misapplied price regulation can indeed lead to gluts, shortage, mangled incentives, and destructive allocations. It really does depend.</p>
    <p>If you already know whether you like a "ban on price gouging" without having seen the details of the proposal, you are just an ideologue, one way or the other. If you hold yourself out as an economist and you are taking a strong position on the proposal at its current level of unspecificity, might I recommend my recent piece on <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/09/authority-minimization/index.html">authority minimization</a>?</p>
    <p>Rather than get ahead of ourselves, let's discuss a form of price reform that is occurring already, without any impetus from the state. <em>The American Prospect</em> recently did a <a href="https://prospect.org/pricing">full, remarkable issue</a> on pricing, emphasizing price discrimination or "personalized pricing".</p>
    <p>I find it a bit counterintuitive that it's my friends at <em>The American Prospect</em> who get upset about this, rather than my friends at George Mason University. (With genuine affection, I consider GMU Economics to be the lightbearer for Hayekian economics, now that the man himself has left us.)</p>
    <p>A common apology for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-are-different-types-price-discrimination-and-how-are-they-used.asp">first degree price discrimination</a> is that it's "efficient". And it is, in one narrow sense. Let's review the Econ-101-style diagrams below (modified from an <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5117.html">old piece</a>):</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/18/murdering-hayek/murdering-hayek-pricing-diagrams.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/18/murdering-hayek/murdering-hayek-pricing-diagrams.png"></a></p>
    <p>The upper-left-hand diagram shows the Marshallian equilibrium that we ordinarily imagine as efficient. When the price — there is just one price, the same public price for everyone — has <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tatonnement">groped</a> to where the supply and demand curves meet, both the quantity exchanged and total surplus is maximized.</p>
    <p>The bottom row shows two pathological cases. If the price is prevented from finding the equilibrium price — whether by private market power or by public regulation — there is "deadweight loss" (the red triangles). Total surplus is reduced.</p>
    <p>Surplus is a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5149.html">problematic measure</a> of welfare, but Econ 101 courses disgracefully treat the two as interchangeable, so the smarty-pants pundit class does the same. Under this analysis, price-setting, whether by states or by monopolies, makes the collective "us" <em>prima facie</em> worse off.</p>
    <p>The diagram on the upper right depicts "perfect" or "first degree" price discrimination. That's when sellers know precisely the maximum amount each potential customer would be willing to pay for an item, and charges precisely that. No real-life seller can know preferences so perfectly, but digital tools now surveil, study, cluster, and predict our behavior pretty well. In an app, on a website, even <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/17/nx-s1-5009271/electronic-shelf-labels-prices-walmart-grocery-store">in a grocery store</a>, pricing can increasingly be tailored to us.</p>
    <p>Notice that in this diagram there are no scary red triangles, there is no deadweight loss. The quantity exchanged and the total surplus are the same as at the Marshallian equilibrium. So first-degree price discrimination is "efficient".</p>
    <p>The difference from the competitive equilibrium (upper-left) is only distributional: In the single-price, Marshallian case, consumers and producers split the surplus. In the price-discrimination case, producers enjoy all the surplus, and consumers enjoy none. The purchases are "worth it" to buyers, but just. Whatever consumers have bought is worth barely more to them than the dollars they have spent. Sellers, on the other hand, receive a lot more money than it cost to market the good.</p>
    <p>To a certain kind of economist, distribution doesn't matter, or is a second-order concern. That is far from my own view. People "on the left" tend to dislike price discrimination, because producer surplus (business profit) goes disproportionately to the already wealthy, while consumer surplus would have been more broadly distributed.</p>
    <p>If you are Hayekian, you should have a different but equally fatal concern.</p>
    <p>From Hayek's <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html"><em>The Use of Knowledge in Society</em></a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>[T]he economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place... [T]he ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them... But the “man on the spot” cannot decide solely on the basis of his limited but intimate knowledge of the facts of his immediate surroundings. There still remains the problem of communicating to him such further information as he needs to fit his decisions into the whole pattern of changes of the larger economic system...</p>
     <p>[T]his problem can be solved, and in fact is being solved, by the price system...</p>
     <p>[I]n a system in which the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed among many people, prices can act to coördinate the separate actions of different people in the same way as subjective values help the individual to coördinate the parts of his plan. It is worth contemplating for a moment a very simple and commonplace instance of the action of the price system to see what precisely it accomplishes. Assume that somewhere in the world a new opportunity for the use of some raw material, say, tin, has arisen, or that one of the sources of supply of tin has been eliminated. It does not matter for our purpose — and it is very significant that it does not matter — which of these two causes has made tin more scarce. All that the users of tin need to know is that some of the tin they used to consume is now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in consequence, they must economize tin... <strong>The mere fact that there is one price for any commodity — or rather that local prices are connected in a manner determined by the cost of transport, etc. — brings about the solution which (it is just conceptually possible) might have been arrived at by one single mind possessing all the information which is in fact dispersed among all the people involved in the process.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
    <p>Let's consider a concrete case. I need a new roof, which could be made of tin or plastic. I prefer tin. I'd be willing to pay up to $9000 for a tin roof and $5000 for a plastic roof. A price discriminating monopolist offers me precisely those prices. Which I choose is then a flip of the coin. I've been deprived of information that might distinguish them. At these prices, I'm indifferent between the two options, or even to not buying at all.</p>
    <p>Suppose that under a competitive single-price equilibrium, the tin roof would have cost $6000, and the plastic roof would have cost $1000. Because tin is dear relative to my own knowledge of my preferences (my surplus for tin would be $3000, for plastic $4000), I would have economized and purchased plastic, contributing to an efficient allocation. But under perfect price discrimination, my contribution to the as-if "single mind possessing all the information" is reduced to noise, a fifty-fifty coin flip.</p>
    <p><em>Ah!</em> you say, <em>But the price discriminating seller wouldn't behave this way!</em> Megacorp would know the "true" prices of underlying commodities, and would profit more from offering the plastic roof for $4900. At this price, I reliably choose plastic, the seller makes $3900 rather than the mere $3000 it would have made from tin, and tin is economized as it would be in a competitive market.</p>
    <p>But then what you are saying is Megacorp's knowledge is sufficient to completely cut me out of the information aggregation process with no loss. My local information has no role to play. Megacorp knows me well enough to prejudge me and perform my role.</p>
    <p>And maybe so! I don't know very much.</p>
    <p>But it's turtles all the way down. If cartel and price discrimination are normalized, then Megacorp's vendors are also predicting what Megacorp will pay, and providing prices that maximize its own profits rather than reflect underlying social costs. Megacorp is also cut out of any role in the information problem. The system ultimately works — correctly solves the market optimization problem — only if there is some foundational set of vendors, a cartel for whom Hayek's "dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge" have been surveilled and aggregated and reconciled after all.</p>
    <p>Long ago I <a href="https://x.com/interfluidity/status/908391949350051840">tweeted</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>path to socialism: Amazon solves economic calculation problem and swallows the whole economy. then we nationalize it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If you think an economy in which price discrimination is normalized can be efficient, then you think Hayek's work is obsolete. The cartel that price discriminates constitutes a capable central planner. If we will have a capable central planner, most of us would have it under the control of an imperfectly democratic state, rather than operate as a maximizer of private shareholders' wealth.</p>
    <p>I do not in fact think Hayek is obsolete. Neither Amazon nor ChatGPT can incorporate the ever-changing, infintely dispersed knowledge that drove Hayek's vision.</p>
    <p>But if Hayek is not obsolete, if we move towards "personalized pricing", firms will routinely price discriminate but misjudge. On the one hand, that means at least sometimes consumers will still enjoy surplus. Hooray!</p>
    <p>At the systemic level, however, it means our optimizer will be badly broken, and we will all be made the poorer. Megacorp will think I'd be willing to pay $6000 for a plastic roof, and so offer it to me for $5900. But for that price, I prefer the tin. A social resource will have been diverted from a high-value to a low-value use, because our price-discriminating planner erred. Multiply this kind of mistake countless times, and Hayek's “economic calculus” goes haywire. We will have destroyed the very purpose and function of markets in our economy.</p>
    <p>Either price discrimination can be perfected, and we should move to a centrally planned economy. Or it cannot be, Hayek remains right, and we should insist on competitive markets with single public prices. Which is it?</p>
    <p>"I have deliberately used the word 'marvel' to shock the reader out of the complacency with which we often take the working of this mechanism for granted," Hayek <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html">writes</a> of the price system.</p>
    <p>I find it astonishing how untroubled Hayek's successors now seem by developments that could only be wise if Hayek's marvel has become a museum piece.</p>
    <p>Maybe AI really will do a better job of allocating scarce resources than markets and the price system used to. Maybe it really is time to move on.</p>
    <p>But you'd think Hayekians would be evaluating that claim skeptically, rather than cheerleading the change.</p>

    <p>Zongyuan Zoe Liu has <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-real-economic-crisis">a piece in <em>Foreign Affairs</em></a> on the contemporary Chinese economy (ht <a href="https://x.com/michaelxpettis/status/1821777692275953789">Michael Pettis</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Brad_Setser/status/1821632733094785513">Brad Setser</a>). As description, the piece is excellent. As prescription, well, I take the other side.</p>
    <p>The financial and economic model that China stumbled into — as Liu points out, as early as 1980, under Deng Xiaoping — is far from perfect. It was an improvisation, not a designed thing. Its pieces don't quite fit together. Inconsistencies must be put off and papered over. Financial arrangements have emerged that obscure and render stable contradictions rather than address or resolve them. Perhaps that is a talent China has <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/548.html">learned from us</a>.</p>
    <p>Yet as we survey the past forty years, we should ask a simple question and answer it honestly. Which model has been more successful, mainstream Western economics or China's improvised heterodoxy?</p>
    <p>I think China wins. It certainly wins in terms of national development and "national greatness". I think it also has done a better job of improving citizen welfare.</p>
    <p>In the past you could argue that China's model was fine for catapulting a poor, backwards economy towards the "technological frontier", but that economies already at the frontier require the considered rationality only Western economics can offer. However, China is no longer a poor, backwards economy. Yes, in income-per-capita terms, China remains a developing country. But it boasts a middle class that enjoys developed-world living standards and is larger than most developed countries. In many respects, China <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/06/12/china-has-become-a-scientific-superpower">now defines</a> the technological frontier.</p>
    <p>The transit writer <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/">Alon Levy</a> often <a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2024/08/07/more-on-american-incuriosity-new-york-regional-rail-edition-part-1-european-history/">remarks</a> of the United States that it fails to accomplish things that are common and easy everywhere else, because Americans simply refuse to accept they have something to learn. I think the West writ large makes the same mistake with respect to China.</p>
    <p>To be very clear, I do not embrace China's political model. I believe China's economic model can be adapted to Western democracy. In fact, I think the model would be much improved by a more intentional implementation, designed for rule under less discretionary law. Subsidy that China provides through <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">informal encouragement of politically sensitive banks</a> could be provided via overt government programs. <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/26/banks-should-fail-much-more-often/index.html">Mechanisms of accountability</a> can be developed and agreed to <em>ex ante</em>, rather than applied <em>ad hoc</em>, <em>ex post</em>, when forbearance can no longer be sustained on bad loans that serve as fig-leaves for subsidy.</p>

    <p>I loved this zinger from the Liu article:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>In the West, money influences politics, but in China it is the opposite: politics influences money.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The implication is that this is a problem. Liu writes from an orthodox Western economic perspective, under which there are free markets whose basic nature is to optimize and yield efficient outcomes, but which politics might "distort".</p>
    <p>When I read the quip, however, I think of Karl Polanyi's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)"><em>Great Transformation</em></a>, and the necessity of embedding of economic life in social relations. Democratic politics <em>should</em> influence the sphere of money, exchange, and production, which is only a means to the end of general welfare. China's putative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole-process_people%27s_democracy">"whole-process people's democracy"</a> is not my democratic ideal. But it is more democratic than the plutocracy that emerges (but proves unstable) when economic liberalism is allowed to run unchecked. From Polanyi's perspective, and mine, of course "politics influences money". It should. The question is how.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/13/china-as-a-model/#thick-antitrust" id="thick-antitrust" name="thick-antitrust" class="anchorlink"></a>Thick antitrust</h3>
    <p>Very often, what Liu describes as a deficiency of the Chinese model, I would describe as an advantage:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>A larger problem with China’s reliance on local government to implement industrial policy is that it causes cities and regions across the country to compete in the same sectors rather than complement each other or play to their own strengths. Thus, for more than two decades, Chinese provinces—from Xinjiang in the west to Shanghai in the east, from Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan in the south—have, with very little coordination between them, established factories in the same government-designated priority industries, driven by provincial and local officials’ efforts to outperform their peers. Inevitably, this domestic competition has led to overcapacity and high levels of debt, even in industries in which China has gained global market dominance...</p>
     <p>Whenever the Chinese government prioritizes a new sector, duplicative investments by local governments inevitably fuel intense domestic competition.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Vigorous competition is what distinguishes a virtuous market economy from a predatory racket. In the United States, we rely upon regulation and litigation by antitrust authorities to ensure that markets remain open and competitive.</p>
    <p>But that is a fragile solution. In the best of times — which is now, thank you Lina Khan, Jonathan Kanter, Joe Biden — scarce enforcement resources must be devoted to an eternal game of Whac-A-Mole.</p>
    <p>Times are not usually the best of times, alas. The core talent of <em>Homo sapiens</em> is to coordinate in mutual interest. As Adam Smith famously <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/adam-smith/the-wealth-of-nations/text/single-page">wrote</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When nascent concentrations of wealth can be laundered into influence, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1258156478.shtml">political economy renders regulation less and less zealous</a>. Eventually some crisis — political, economic, or financial — reawakens dormant vigilence. But only after a great deal of damage is done.</p>
    <p>A <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/197.html">perennial</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/24/thick-antitrust/index.html">theme</a> of this blog is that we should prefer structural rather than supervisory solutions to regulatory problems.</p>
    <p>I doubt it was predicted or designed, but when the practice emerged of delegating industrial policy to local governments, China invented a structural form of antitrust. The central state declares what industries are to be favored, and then many localities toss contenders into the ring. The unsurprising result is competition. At the national level, with astonishing speed, industries with world-class competences emerge, even when — especially when — no "national champion" comes to dominate.</p>
    <p>Great industries are what a nation wants, not great firms. Firms are just the players. They perform extraordinary feats, and we cheer them, but they come and go. The industry is the league. It is what endures and delivers decade after decade.</p>
    <p>A decade ago China did not produce electric vehicles. Now <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/">it is the world leader</a>. It is the same story with batteries, solar panels, steel.</p>
    <p>In the US, we tend to provide government support to established national champions, <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/14/seeing-like-a-ceo/index.html">Boeing</a> perhaps, or <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/10/leadership-lessons-intel-apple-wrong-ceos-corporate-decline/">Intel</a>. How is that working for us? Large consolidated firms <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/11/indirection-and-the-character-of-capitalism-part-ii/index.html">become specialists</a> in exploiting market power and political influence rather than any technical facet of production. What if we financed state governments to field local heroes and compete in the big leagues?</p>
    <p>It boggles the American imagination to think that medium-sized, US-state-level enterprises could compete in high-tech, capital-intensive industries. But isn't China's experience an existence proof? Shouldn't the share-buyback-heavy, technical-achievement-light experience of firms like Boeing and Intel chasten our conventional wisdom?</p>
    <p>If we were to try to replicate China's model, there are also negative lessons we should learn from China. Rather than let ongoing state support derive from losses that go unrecognized on bank balance sheets — or that accumulate, Enron-style, in special-purpose vehicles that might have names like "Dorian Gray Selfie" — we should invent arrangements that offer continuing rates of subsidy to our contenders on preagreed terms.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/13/china-as-a-model/#overcapacity" id="overcapacity" name="overcapacity" class="anchorlink"></a>Overcapacity</h3>
    <p>The scourge of Liu's piece is "overcapacity". I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/166.html">first wrote</a> to address panics over Chinese overcapacity in 2008. Despite unceasing handwringing by Western economists, I think China has done pretty well over the last 16 years. What economists call "overcapacity" is usually a distributional problem.</p>
    <p>Again, I think we are running up against a flaw in orthodox economic thinking. In theory, the market is an optimizer. If you are willing to make lots of assumptions (perfect information, perfect competition, a "correct" distribution of initial endowments among consumers, only variable, marginally-increasing costs in production, etc.), you can tell a story under which there is one socially optimal level of production for each good and service. At that nirvana, all firms enjoy precisely zero economic profit.</p>
    <p>Under this theory, whose teleological purpose is a unique optimum, overcapacity is a real thing. At the optimum, all resources are employed. Deviating by producing too much of one thing requires producing too little of something else, or else investing too little in future production. One symptom of overcapacity in this theory would be firms operating at an economic loss, or equivalently, requiring a subsidy to break even.</p>
    <p>This brings us again to the flawed intuition that our task is to protect a putative optimum from distortion. State subsidy "distorts" economic activity from its one true optimality by provoking and permitting overcapacity.</p>
    <p>But the only way there could be a general overcapacity, as opposed to overcapacity of some particular good or service, would be if there were an inadequate level of investment for the future. No one can credibly accuse China of that. So the issue becomes China's "strategic" goods and services — solar panels, electric vehicles, batteries — are overproduced relative to, say, consumer goods and services that might be produced if subsidies to strategic industries disappeared and household incomes were higher.</p>
    <p>Western economists who are often shy about addressing distributional issues in our own economies have a very strong view that ordinary househods should have more purchasing power and Xi Jinping should have less. Maybe so!</p>
    <p>But let's consider a model with three classes of purchaser: Ordinary households, Xi Jinping, and Marc Andreeson. There is the economy that would have prevailed if only ordinary households had puchasing power, in roughly equal amounts. There is the economy that prevails when a very large pool of purchasing power is directed by Xi Jinping. Xi uses this purchasing power to produce a lot more steel, batteries, EVs, solar panels, on the theory that strategic, rather than demand-driven investment in those sectors will leave his nation-state better positioned for the future. No doubt, the resulting is an economy "distorted" relative to an entirely demand-driven economy.</p>
    <p>Now let's transfer the purchasing power under Xi's direction to Andreeson. (I'm using poor Marc here as a stand-in for the venture capital industry. I'm not making specific claims about the man.) Marc does not invest so much in steel, solar, or EVs, because he knows there will be inadequate demand for those goods to recoup Xi-scale investments. Where Xi subsidizes loss-making solar panel companies, Andreeson subsidizes loss-making Ubers, DoorDashes, etc. on the theory that he can eventually recoup those losses by scaling fastest in what will become winner-take-all markets, and earning thick profits thereafter. This economy also is "distorted" relative to an economy driven only by meeting demand from hypothetical approximately equal households. It is warped beyond recognition relative to the optimum under any model in which perfect competition would obtain.</p>
    <p>Western economists applaud Andreeson's economy, but disparage Xi's. I think that is madness.</p>
    <p>Perhaps China devotes too much of its resources to strategic investment and should leave more in the hands of consumers to enjoy. But the quality of strategic investment in China is much higher than in Western economies, in large part because China structures its investments so that they finance bitterly competitive industries, while profit-motivated Western investors quite openly seek "moats" to support margins that should not even exist under the hypothetical optimality that economists must presume guides production, if they are going to make claims about "overcapacity" driven by state subsidy.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/13/china-as-a-model/#sclerosis" id="sclerosis" name="sclerosis" class="anchorlink"></a>Sclerosis</h3>
    <p>Instead of asking how we can achieve optimality against the risk of distortion, it is more constructive to ask how we can achieve capabilty against the risk of sclerosis.</p>
    <p>In our fallen world, there is no such thing as optimal. When toy models are grafted onto real circumstances to advance some claim of optimality, you are being snowed.</p>
    <p>In real life, we never have the choice not to err. We will err. A choice we often do have is in which direction to err. We cannot, in any industry, discover the true, correct amount that should be produced. We can create circumstances under which we are likely to err by producing too much, or to err by producing to little.</p>
    <p>Overcapacity implies capacity. If we err by producing too little, we may not develop the know-how, the process knowledge, to be capable of producing at all. (See <a href="https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/">Dan Wang</a>.) We know there are positive externalities to manufacturing, and developing ecosystems that support it. So in perfectly orthodox economic terms, manufacturing, at least in strategic industries, should be subsidized. In fact, if we are only producing at the market-optimal level — if, before any subsidy, firms in competitive industries are not, on average, loss-making — then we are underproducing. Once we conjure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigouvian_tax">Arthur Pigou</a>, China's "zombie" firms look more like optimality rather than distortion!</p>
    <p>Overcapacity has social option value. You may not need all the capacity you build. After the fact, much of the capacity may be naively condemned as waste. But the future has always been uncertain. Terms of trade might shift. Exigencies like a pandemic might dramatically increase demand for previously obscure goods. It is often wise to pay hard cash for out-of-the-money options, even though those options may never be exercised.</p>
    <p>Industrial capacity has insurance value. Those fire insurance premiums you paid were not a rip-off, just because the house never burned. In important industries, if we are not developing at scales that would, under vigorus competition, leave firms making losses absent subsidy, then we are not investing wisely.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/13/china-as-a-model/#beggar-thy-neighbor" id="beggar-thy-neighbor" name="beggar-thy-neighbor" class="anchorlink"></a>Beggar thy neighbor?</h3>
    <p>Perhaps China's economic model is good for China. But is it good for, fair to, everyone else? Could other countries adapt and adopt it, or is it based fundamentally on a kind of parasitism that cannot scale?</p>
    <p>From the Liu piece:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>In a speech in May, Lael Brainard, the director of the Biden administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, warned that China’s “policy-driven industrial overcapacity”—a euphemism for antimarket practices—was hurting the global economy. By enforcing policies that “unfairly depress capital, labor, and energy costs” and allow Chinese firms to sell “at or below cost,” she said, China now accounts for a huge percentage of global capacity in electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors, and other sectors. As a consequence, Beijing is hampering innovation and competition in the global marketplace, threatening jobs in the United States and elsewhere, and limiting the ability of the United States and other Western countries to build supply chain resilience.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>No offense to Brainard, but I think this kind of complaint is just pathetic. The United States and Europe are not small, weak, actors, helpless against Chinese economic imperialism. We are — and have been for much longer than China — rich, powerful, and capable. Let's take <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/71.html">some responsibility</a> for our own policy decisions.</p>
    <p>China stumbled into, then doubled down on, a set of policies that has served its people and its interests extraordinarily well, for decades. None of this is new. The terms of trade we offer China — with respect to goods and the investment vehicles that make possible China's surplus — have always been ours to choose. We can close our borders to any or all of China's industries if we want to and we are serious about it. That would be very painful for us now, but it has become so difficult only because we've made stupid mistakes for years.</p>
    <p>To be very clear, I think it would have been horrible if we had simply closed our borders to China in 1995, or if we fully closed our borders now. China's rise has been a miracle for human welfare. It did not have to also become a catastrophe for the United States. We could have, we absolutely should have, offered terms-of-trade that protected our interests while encouraging mutually beneficial exchange.</p>
    <p>It is not hard to devise mechanisms that would regulate our (multilateral) balance-of-trade. We can ensure our trade with the rest-of-the-world is balanced, or only as imbalanced as we choose. Warren Buffett offered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import_certificates">a proposal</a> in 2003. My preference (with e.g. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/29/capital-flow-united-states-economy-trade-deficit/">Michael Pettis</a>) is for "<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/540.html">capital account protectionism</a>". These are things we can do, and always could have done, that would have regulated trade without slamming shut our doors or discriminating against particular countries. They are things that we still should do.</p>
    <p>In the current era of geopolitical concern and heightened distrust, broad controls on the balance of trade will unfortunately not be sufficient. China invests in vast capacity across a whole range of strategic industries, because that's the right thing to do <em>for China</em>. It develops the country's capabilities, and works to expand its options, even under terrible contingencies like an abrupt decoupling from the West due to sanctions. The United States will need to do the same things, for the same reasons. Building capacity well beyond near-term domestic demand means the marginal cost of producing for export becomes very low. That's the case already for China. But the logic is portable.</p>
    <p>So yes, China will sell goods very cheaply into export markets, if destination countries are willing to let buyers buy. Whether they do is destination countries' choice. Some countries will consider an industry strategic. They will and should use tariffs or other means to protect domestic production. Other countries will let their consumers enjoy very cheap goods, when multiple powers build capacity and then compete to sell low-marginal-cost excess production abroad. The net effect will be a consumer subsidy from "strategic powers" (in any given industry) to the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>That's not a bad thing! That "rest of the world" will most of the time include most poorer countries. The developing world buys everything from China today. If the United States adopts China's model, then US-produced goods will become competitive with Chinese goods. Third-country markets will become the measure of relative quality, and hopefully serve to check more corrupt variants of protectionism. If, under a pretext of "strategic", the US protects an industry, not to develop know-how and capacity, but to enable US producers to fleece domestic consumers, we will know it, because American exports will not be competitive, on price and quality, in countries that permit the sale of both on equal terms.</p>
    <p>American goods, produced at American wages, can be competitive with Chinese goods in world markets! We are so mired in learned helplessness, the very possibility shocks our intuitions. But China's advantage in world trade no longer derives from low labor costs. China sells so cheaply because it has made itself so capable, in precisely the sense that the word "overcapacity" means to scold. If we, like China, find ways to develop overcapacity in our industries while maintaining vigorous competition among our firms, then our exports will be very cheap as well. The factories will already have been built. Churning out another one for overseas sale will be just the cost of inputs.</p>
    <p>But can China's model even work if other powers also adopt it? China has relied upon large trade surpluses.</p>
    <p>Suppose that Europe, China, India, and a trading block including North America and the United States' Pacific allies each adopt China's model. For industries that one power considers strategic but others do not, China's model can work just as it does now. For industries that multiple blocks consider strategic, any surplus could only emerge to the degree nonaligned powers prove willing to accept a trade deficit — and global (or perhaps less-than-global) capital markets prove willing to finance it. With bids from the largest export markets cut off, export prices and the profitiability of external sales would be lower than they have been. Overall, surpluses would be much smaller than what China has enjoyed.</p>
    <p>So does that kill the model? No. It just makes it more expensive. The profits that Chinese firms have taken from export sales would have to be replaced in large part by state subsidy. In accounting terms, as support from the foreign sector recedes, the government sector will have to step in to fill the gap. "Excess" capacity — and the know-how and option value it brings — will be more expensive in this brave new world than it has been thus far for China. Governments might choose to simply pay up for China-scale capacity. Or, at the higher price, they might choose to purchase somewhat less capacity, but enjoy less of the capability that comes bundled with it.</p>
    <p>Whether overtly or covertly, firms in strategic industries will require continuing subsidy. That's not waste. It's wisdom.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/08/13/china-as-a-model/#converge-on-which" id="converge-on-which" name="converge-on-which" class="anchorlink"></a>Converge on which?</h3>
    <p>Liu ends her piece giving advice precisely opposite to mine.</p>
    <p>Liu points out, correctly, that the US adopting China's approach — and therefore regaining some supply-chain independence from China — will only cause China to pursue initiatives like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025">Made in China 2025</a> even more urgently. A more decoupled world is a world in which war between these great powers — these wonderful coutries! — arguably becomes less unthinkable.</p>
    <p>Liu suggests that with negotiation, we could mutually find our way back to a liberal international trade system, except this time — this time! — China would abandon the development model that has served it so extraordinarily. China would cease laundering the state subsidy at that model's core through a trade system that ostensibly forbids it. The great powers would remain interwoven by commerce, intertwined in mutual dependence, making it more likely that our geopolitical disputes would be resolved peacefully.</p>
    <p>That's a movie we've seen before. It was the story of why World War I could never happen. World War I did happen. "Mutual dependence" is a gauzy, hopeful phrase. But when you drill down into it, you find heterogeneous networks of asymmetric dependencies and capabilities that can, as Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman famously point out, be <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/introducing-new-paper-weaponized-interdependence">weaponized</a>. When geopolitical disputes smolder, economic interdependence may not improve trust. It can become a battlefield, a site for low intensity conflict that increases risks of escalation to something much, much worse.</p>
    <p>I don't have a surefire prescription for peace. But I think great powers that are capable and secure are likely to be less prone to conflict than powers that feel like they are declining, or contained, or otherwise threatened. Housemates squabble. Good fences make good neighbors.</p>
    <p>Liu proposes that we negotiate to try to reconverge on the Western model of liberal trade and interdependence. That convergence was the hope and the project of the last few decades. It has failed, dangerously. It is certainly possible that we could try again, learn from our mistakes, make it work.</p>
    <p>My suggestion is that we aim slowly, incrementally but intentionally, to converge upon China's economic model. Under mutual adoption, the model would change a bit. Excess capacity would become more costly, due to less help from a foreign surplus. But the core of the model would remain sound. In a nutshell...</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>Excess capacity is better than scarce capacity, for its option value and for the externalities in process knowledge and generalized capability that derive from manufacturing. Err on the side of overcapacity.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>The positive externalities of capacity merit subsidy. Subsidize.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Vouchsafe competition by constraining the structure of industries in how you structure the subsidies. Don't rely solely on regulatory supervision and enforcement, which risks an endless cat-and-mouse game against "innovators" in cartel and consolidation.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Domestically, China's model has simply outperformed the 19th Century economic model that we keep falling back to. Internationally, I think converging on the China model would better serve the cause of peace.</p>
    <p>If you haven't read <a href="https://jmaynardkeynes.ucc.ie/national-self-sufficiency.html">Keynes' speech on national self-sufficiency</a>, I don't know why you are wasting time on my drivel. 1933 was a time not so unlike our own. Unfortunately.</p>
    <p>I'll let the gentleman have the last word:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>We are pacifist to-day with so much strength of conviction that, if the economic internationalist could win this point, he would soon recapture our support. But it does not to-day seem obvious that a great concentration of national effort on the capture of foreign trade, that the penetration of a country's economic structure by the resources and the influence of foreign capitalists, that a close dependence of our own economic life on the fluctuating economic policies of foreign countries are safeguards and assurances of international peace. It is easier, in the light of experience and foresight, to argue quite the contrary...</p>
     <p>Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel these are the things which should of their nature be international. But let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national. Yet, at the same time, those who seek to disembarrass a country of its entanglements should be very slow and wary. It should not be a matter of tearing up roots but of slowly training a plant to grow in a different direction. For these strong reasons, therefore, I am inclined to the belief that, after the transition is accomplished, a greater measure of national self-sufficiency and economic isolation between countries, than existed in 1914, may tend to serve the cause of peace rather than otherwise.</p>

    <p>Sixteen years ago, I was amped for the election of Barack Obama. I was all-in.</p>
    <p>To say that I was disappointed by Obama's presidency is an <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/11/30/obama-was-the-most-destructive-political-figure-of-my-lifetime/index.html">understatement</a>. I think Barack Obama broke my country. We are not red states or blue states but the United States of America, he famously loved to say. We are one country, undivided.</p>
    <p>But what he proved by his administration's choices is that there are creditors whom the law protects but does not bind, and there are debtors whom the law binds but does not protect. Barack Obama's oratory was soaring, inspiring, progressive. But his governance was the <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288">very definition</a> of conservative. There was just nothing and nobody left to trust.</p>
    <p>When "even the liberals" follow Wilhoit's Law, the only thing left to fight over is who's the in-group. Donald Trump perceived that, and we've been fighting it out ever since.</p>
    <p>Today I find that I am all-in for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. And I am terrified.</p>
    <p>Like a true-believing Calvinist fearful his predestiny might not be among the elect, I find myself trawling for signs, signs, signs. Will Harris continue the Biden-Harris administration's excellent start at reigning in corporate power, supporting labor, challenging plutocracy, building a nation that prospers not because "merit" is excusive, but because there is a successful place for all of us? Will Harris support the version of "free enterprise" that I support, under which the least of us, with grit and a good idea, can compete to offer wonders to our neighbors, and prosper from the good we do for others, without being bought-out or or rolled-up or crushed by monied interests? Or will she take "free enterprise" to mean what the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce mean — that big business must be left to do what it wants, regardless of how extractive or predatory their actions "superficially" appear to be, because the market knows our interest better than we do, even as we are foreclosed, evicted, outsourced, overcharged, and penalized?</p>
    <p>No matter how devout is our dear Calvinist, God does not actually reveal in signs who is among the elect, or who is damned.</p>
    <p>I can find hopeful signs, like Harris' choice of Tim Walz as running mate. I can find awful signs, like <a href="https://x.com/EugenePuryear/status/1821347244655640811">this from Maryland governor Wes Moore</a>. Matt Stoller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/opinion/kamala-harris-google-antitrust.html">reads entrails</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
    <p>But there were no reliable signs that Joe Biden — the Senator from MBNA, a man whose approach to bankruptcy law had previously been the white-shoe version of loan-shark kneecapping — would govern as heir to LBJ and FDR. The fact is we cannot know.</p>
    <p>"Surrogate" Wes Moore can go on CNBC and paint a picture of Kamala Harris that inspires in CEOs the same emotion Taylor Swift conjures in a middle-school field hockey team. And that's fine. That's what he should do, if his goal is to help Harris win. Whatever a "surrogate" says, Harris herself has not made any promises.</p>
    <p>We might prefer a version of democracy in which candidates make clear statements about how they would govern, and the public makes an informed choice among those alternatives.</p>
    <p>That would require a very different political system.</p>
    <p>Our actual system requires a candidate for the Presidency to win roughly 50% of votes cast. Yet no candidate, under a glare of full transparency, with (implausible) complete foresight about how they would govern, could avoid alienating more than 50% of the electorate on at least one of the dozens of issues people care about.</p>
    <p>Candidates run on vibes and empty platitudes as much as they can for the same reason network television was bad in the 1980s — not because it is what "the public" actually wants, but because the less real substance attaches to a thing, the greater the share of a diverse and fractious population that can tolerate it. The trick is to entertain (on television) or to inspire (in politics) without actually touching on anything that might piss somebody off.</p>
    <p>When it is more important to please everybody just a little than to please anybody all that much, what you offer is sweet nothings. Or, if you go negative, condemnations of vague categories not so many people identify with — "extremist", "leftist", "elite", "MAGA", "illegal".</p>
    <p>We know where Kamala Harris stands on abortion rights, because restoring Roe is very broadly popular. We know where Donald Trump stands on immigration, because tighter restriction is very broadly popular.</p>
    <p>When Project 2025 seemed to tell us, in extraordinary and exhaustive detail, what Donald Trump might do, it revealed a lot that might not be so broadly popular. Trump promptly disavowed it. We really can know very little about what these people will actually do. When we know too much, it is because they have made a mistake.</p>
    <p>We do know Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVjraH4Ydxw">stands with unions</a>. She has made strong public promises. That's a big fucking deal! Unions are a wedge issue within a Democratic coalition that still includes a big-business donor class and the Clintonian technocrats who several decades ago worked to seal the coffin on the labor movement in order to appease Alan Greenspan.</p>
    <p>So why do we know Kamala Harris stands with unions? Because, thank goodness, the most important battleground states are Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where unions are strong and very broadly popular.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html">remarkable work</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp_6fvf3Lzw">Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter</a> is a bit more arcane. It derives from a broad, populist demand to reign in buttfuckery and abuse we all experience from businesses we detest but cannot escape. But antitrust litigation is less participatory, less accessible, than a strike at the plant. There's no mass constituency in Pennsylvania whose vote will depend on <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/">Matt Stoller's</a> endorsement. Public promises are unlikely to be made by the campaign. A new administration could sell us out. Absolutely.</p>
    <p>But we are not the only ones a new administration might sell out. Sometimes there is no way to know who is the diner and who is the food until the meal commences.</p>
    <p>A Calvinist cannot know whether he is predestined for salvation or damnation. The best he can do is to perform good works, to live a life consistent with election. Standing around and bargaining with God, looking for signs and objecting to bad ones, is perhaps not a life best lived.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">United States Supreme Court notwithstanding</a>, the US President is not God. And nothing in our politics is predestined. But a life well-lived still demands a leap of faith.</p>
    <p>I'm all-in for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. We can support the campaign, while we cheerfully express the values that are guiding us as we do. I believe the United States' economy will require, over time, a pretty wholesale restructuring — so that business is a level playing field any of us can contest, so that workers have great choices employers compete to sweeten, so that the most successful among us get rich enough to live lives of enviable luxury, but never so rich they are ever more than one person with one vote in the governance of our affairs.</p>

    <p>We are so accustomed to being betrayed.</p>
    <p>Throughout the Clinton years, and especially the Obama years, we thought we were voting for Franklin Roosevelt’s party. Instead we found ourselves governed by parodies of Ronald Reagan, except garishly prouder of their fancier degrees. The arc of history bent toward every sort of justice except economic justice.</p>
    <p>Joe Biden, to his magnificent credit, strived, even if he did not always succeed, to govern in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt. But his term and his time are ending.</p>
    <p>So we are naked again. Of course, next year we might just be governed by fascists. We must do all we possibly can to prevent that. But does that mean we must struggle to elect another cadre of arrogant professionals who will <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4792753-gavin-newsom-executive-homeless-encampments-supreme-court-ruling/">clear us from their streets when we have nowhere to go</a>, even while they righteously rail against the Supreme Court justices who grant them the tools to do so?</p>
    <p>Only if we make that a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
    <p>A lot of angst has gone into reading tea leaves about who Kamala Harris <em>really</em> is. She has friends and colleagues among the corporate elite! When as Vice President she liaised with wealthy businessmen and courted their support, the poor dears lamented the burden of sitting on the other side of Lina Khan’s FTC. Harris duly sympathized.</p>
    <p>Kamala Harris is not a cipher. She is a professional politician. Like all of us, she is a human being with her own passions and principles. At some margin, at some critical moments, those passions and principles may hold sway. But as a professional politician, her work is to build a coalition to get elected, then, once elected, to staff and manage a government that sustains and expands the coalition.</p>
    <p>In a primary process or multiparty election, much of our job would be to suss out various candidate’s predilections, all those passions and principles, and choose which person or party’s values would be most likely to align with our own.</p>
    <p>We are not in a primary process or multiparty election.</p>
    <p>If you are a person who believes that a second Trump term — now with a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">roadmap to Executive impunity</a> from an illegitimate Supreme Court — would be too dangerous to countenance, then you are going to vote for Kamala Harris.</p>
    <p>So. Just like under Obama, they’ll take us for granted. We’ll just have to <em>fall in line</em>, right?</p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>Our job now is to engage in a different kind of politics. A professional politician will dance with the ones that brung ‘em. It’s our job now to be the ones that bring Kamala Harris.</p>
    <p>If Lina-Khan-hating “liberal” corporate lawyers are Harris’ pillars of support, and by those weak pillars she still ekes out a victory over Donald Trump, well, then she might well govern as Obama 2.0 (and render inevitable a Trump 2.0). If Harris perceives her victories as happening despite us — the Bernie-ites, the Warren-ites, the social democrats — then she will do her best to ignore us while she placates her real constituents.</p>
    <p>But if she perceives her victories as happening <em>because</em> of us, then she will work for us and lead our movement.</p>
    <p>As part of that, we will have to rely upon our surrogates to work in private on our behalf. Now is not the time to extract promises in public that might be electorally counterproductive. AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren have access to the candidate. Although it goes against the grain of some naive conceptualizations of democracy, real negotiations happen in private. Sometimes the best that we can do is follow the lead of the people in the room whom we trust.</p>
    <p>There is no point now in grousing or debating like we are contesting a fantasy primary. Kamala Harris has already won. She is the champion we have.</p>
    <p>The work now isn’t for her to win us. It is for us to win her.</p>

    <p>Suppose, <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/findings">completely hypothetically</a>, you ran a small RCT on UBI. (ht <a href="https://x.com/morganwarstler/status/1815479501427712049">Morgan Warstler</a>)</p>
    <p>Then there would be no meaningful</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>increase in labor demand (as a policy choice, or potentially as a direct effect of the UBI if demand is unmanaged) [to] restore[] the original quantity of work provided, but at significantly higher wages.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(Fourth slide above.)</p>
    <p>So what you would expect is to be stuck at the second diagram reproduced above. You would see a some reduction of the quantity of labor supplied, rather than the desired effect of an unchanged quantity of labor supplied, but at somewhat higher wages (the third diagram).</p>
    <p>To the degree that a basic income <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/findings/entrepreneurship">increases</a> <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5066.html">entrepreneurial intentions</a>, that might also, by a completely separate mechanism, yield an immediate-term reduction in employment and income, while recipients reduce labor force participation to devote time to enterprises not yet paying off.</p>
    <p>Hypothetically speaking, a two percentage point difference in employment and 1.3 hour per week average reduction in work hours — with both effects often indistinguishable within a 90% confidence interval, probably always indistinguishable within a more conventional 95% confidence interval — might strike one as a surprisingly small effect for a $1000 per month basic income pilot.</p>
    <p>Which might be a shame! It would suggest only a modest wage increase if a genuinely universal basic income of that amount were enacted, assuming continued full-employment macro policy.</p>
    <p>But, at least directionally, it would suggest an increase in wages for a constant quantity of labor supplied.</p>
    <p>And recipients would enjoy the <em>per se</em> benefits of an extra $1000 a month, taken in some mix of cash and time for education, care, leisure, or entrepreneurship.</p>

    <p>It's a fraught time.</p>
    <p>Last night we endured a ranting lunatic allege that the nearly 80,000 alleged gang members El Salvador's President Bukele has detained without process have been dumped onto America's streets, contributing to a US crime wave that simply does not exist over the relevant time frame. (The crime wave that did exist <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/opinion-ted-cruzs-fearmongering-rnc-105151488.html">emerged only</a> during the ranting lunatic's presidency, years before, and has been subsiding ever since.)</p>
    <p>In the meantime, we still haven't settled on an alternative to the ranting lunatic that sane people might vote for.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, I'm stuck in a news cycle three-weeks old. Remember that one? The one that marked the <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">end of liberal democracy</a> in the United States by providing a road map for how a US President can wield the vast powers of the American state without He or His <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/05/if-the-issue-was-the-lawfare/index.html">suboordinates</a> facing any practical risk of accountability to the law?</p>
    <p>I mean, I know there has been a <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/the-changes-in-vibes-why-did-they-happen.html">vibe shift</a>. But I'm having a hard time letting go of the whole liberal democracy thing. I guess it's pretty cringe.</p>
    <p>Anyway, this piece won't be an essay. It will mostly be exceprts of the Supreme Court decision, concurrences, and dissents. I've discussed <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> a lot over the last few weeks, and I just want to keep some of the most prominent bits around to refer to.</p>
    <p>Before delving into the effluent from the Injustices of our Supreme Coup, I want to reproduce a sketch from Asha Rangappa. (Click for full size.)</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/19/trump-v-united-states-greatest-hits/asha-rangappa-flow-chart_1146x896.png"><img width="100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/19/trump-v-united-states-greatest-hits/asha-rangappa-flow-chart_1146x896.png" alt="Flowchart of determinations under Trump v. United States immunity tests"></a></p>
    <p>I think it's a very helpful summary. Please do read the <a href="https://asharangappa.substack.com/p/the-bloodless-coup-has-startedwith">excellent essay</a> from which I have stolen it. Rangappa writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>What you might notice if you follow the lines above carefully is that the question of motive — the reason that an action was taken — doesn’t even enter the equation until <em>after</em> the determination of whether the actions was official or unofficial has been made. Indeed, the Court explicitly states that <strong>"In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives."</strong></p>
     <p>This is an astonishing statement, because it effectively means that <strong>it does not matter if a President uses the official levers of power with corrupt intent, for personal gain, or as retribution.</strong> In other words, the Court engages a sleight of hand where a critical distinction between <em>lawful and unlawful conduct</em> — the heart of criminal law, which rests on whether a person acted with a specific state of mind, or <em>mens rea</em> — ceases to exist when it comes to the President.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Let's go now to some selections from the decision. I'll refrain from commenting. I'm just excerpting for posterity. I may add to the collection over time.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/19/trump-v-united-states-greatest-hits/#excerpts-from-opinion-of-the-court-by-john-roberts" id="excerpts-from-opinion-of-the-court-by-john-roberts" name="excerpts-from-opinion-of-the-court-by-john-roberts" class="anchorlink"></a>Excerpts from Opinion of the Court, by John Roberts</h3>
    <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 4:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Citing <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), the [D.C. Circuit] court distinguished between two kinds of official acts: discretionary and ministerial. 91 F. 4th, at 1189–1190. It observed that “although discretionary acts are ‘only politically examinable,’ the judiciary has the power to hear cases” involving ministerial acts that an officer is directed to perform by the legislature. <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Marbury,</em> 1 Cranch, at 166). From this distinction, the D. C. Circuit concluded that the “separation of powers doctrine, as expounded in Marbury and its progeny, necessarily permits the Judiciary to oversee the federal criminal prosecution of a former President for his official acts because the fact of the prosecution means that the former President has allegedly acted in defiance of the Congress’s laws.” 91 F. 4th, at 1191. In the court’s view, the fact that Trump’s actions “allegedly violated generally applicable criminal laws” meant that those actions “were not properly within the scope of his lawful discretion.” <em>Id.</em>, at 1192. The D. C. Circuit thus concluded that Trump had “no structural immunity from the charges in the Indictment.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>No matter the context, the President’s authority to act necessarily "stem[s] either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself." <em>Youngstown,</em> 343 U. S., at 585. In the latter case, the President’s authority is sometimes "conclusive and preclusive." <em>Id.,</em> at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring). When the President exercises such authority, he may act even when the measures he takes are "incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress." <em>Id.,</em> at 637. The exclusive constitutional authority of the President "disabl[es] the Congress from acting upon the subject." <em>Id.,</em> at 637–638. And the courts have "no power to control [the President’s] discretion" when he acts pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution. Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 166.</p>
     <p>If the President claims authority to act but in fact exercises mere “individual will” and “authority without law,” the courts may say so. <em>Youngstown,</em> 343 U. S., at 655 (Jackson, J., concurring). In <em>Youngstown,</em> for instance, we held that President Truman exceeded his constitutional authority when he seized most of the Nation’s steel mills. See <em>id.,</em> at 582–589 (majority opinion). But once it is determined that the President acted within the scope of his exclusive authority, his discretion in exercising such authority cannot be subject to further judicial examination.</p>

    <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 8:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>“To the executive alone is intrusted the power of pardon,” and the “legislature cannot change the effect of such a pardon any more than the executive can change a law.” <em>Id.,</em> at 147–148. The President’s authority to pardon, in other words, is “conclusive and preclusive,” “disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.” <em>Youngstown,</em> 343 U. S., at 637–638 (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, pp. 8-9:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions on subjects within his “conclusive and preclusive” constitutional authority. It follows that an Act of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such Presidential actions. We thus conclude that the President is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 14:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>we conclude that the separation of powers principles explicated in our precedent necessitate at least a <em>presumptive</em> immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility. Such an immunity is required to safeguard the independence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution. Indeed, if presumptive protection for the President is necessary to enable the “effective discharge” of his powers when a prosecutor merely seeks evidence of his official papers and communications, <em>id.,</em> at 711, it is certainly necessary when the prosecutor seeks to charge, try, and imprison the President himself for his official actions. At a minimum, the President must therefore be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” <em>Fitzgerald,</em> 457 U. S., at 754.</p>
     <p>But as we explain below, the current stage of the proceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether this immunity is presumptive or absolute</p>

    <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, pp. 20-21:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>the Executive Branch has “exclusive authority and absolute discretion” to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute, including with respect to allegations of election crime. <em>Nixon,</em> 418 U. S., at 693; see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, 599 U. S. 670, 678–679 (2023) (“Under Article II, the Executive Branch possesses authority to decide ‘how to prioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions against defendants who violate the law.’” (quoting <em>TransUnion LLC</em> v. <em>Ramirez</em>, 594 U. S. 413, 429 (2021))). The President may discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II, §3. And the Attorney General, as head of the Justice Department, acts as the President’s “chief law enforcement officer” who “provides vital assistance to [him] in the performance of [his] constitutional duty to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.’” <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, 472 U. S. 511, 520 (1985) (quoting Art. II, §1, cl. 8).</p>
     <p>Investigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking is “the special province of the Executive Branch,” <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Chaney</em>, 470 U. S. 821, 832 (1985), and the Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President, Art. II, §1. For that reason, Trump’s threatened removal of the Acting Attorney General likewise implicates “conclusive and preclusive” Presidential authority. As we have explained, the President’s power to remove “executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed” may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts. Myers, 272 U. S., at 106, 176; see supra, at 8. The President’s “management of the Executive Branch” requires him to have “unrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates”—such as the Attorney General—“in their most important duties.” <em>Fitzgerald,</em> 457 U. S., at 750 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>
     <p>The indictment’s allegations that the requested investigations were “sham[s]” or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. App. 186–187, Indictment ¶10(c). And the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority. Trump is therefore absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 31:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>If official conduct for which the President is immune may be scrutinized to help secure his conviction, even on charges that purport to be based only on his unofficial conduct, the “intended effect” of immunity would be defeated. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756. The President’s immune conduct would be subject to examination by a jury on the basis of generally applicable criminal laws. Use of evidence about such conduct, even when an indictment alleges only unofficial conduct, would thereby heighten the prospect that the President’s official decisionmaking will be distorted. See <em>Clinton,</em> 520 U. S., at 694, n. 19.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 37:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>We do not ordinarily decline to decide significant constitutional questions based on the Government’s promises of good faith. See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U. S. 460, 480 (2010) (“We would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promised to use it responsibly.”). Nor do we do so today.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 40:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The dissents’ positions in the end boil down to ignoring the Constitution’s separation of powers and the Court’s precedent and instead fear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals about a future where the President “feels empowered to violate federal criminal law.” <em>Post,</em> at 18 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.); see <em>post,</em> at 26, 29–30; <em>post,</em> at 8–9, 10, 12, 16, 20–21 (opinion of JACKSON, J.). The dissents overlook the more likely prospect of an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself, with each successive President free to prosecute his predecessors, yet unable to boldly and fearlessly carry out his duties for fear that he may be next.</p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>The Constitution does not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents can be held liable. Consider a bribery prosecution—a charge not at issue here but one that provides a useful example. The federal bribery statute forbids any public official to seek or accept a thing of value “for or because of any official act.” 18 U. S. C. §201(c). The Constitution, of course, does not authorize a President to seek or accept bribes, so the Government may prosecute him if he does so. See Art. II, §4 (listing “Bribery” as an impeachable offense); see also Memorandum from L. Silberman, Deputy Atty. Gen., to R. Burress, Office of the President, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems Arising Out of the President’s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller To Be Vice President Under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (suggesting that the federal bribery statute applies to the President). Yet excluding from trial any mention of the official act connected to the bribe would hamstring the prosecution. To make sense of charges alleging a <em>quid pro quo</em>, the jury must be allowed to hear about both the <em>quid</em> and the <em>quo</em>, even if the quo, standing alone, could not be a basis for the President’s criminal liability.</p>

    <p><em>From <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong>, dissenting, pp. 10-11:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The majority purports to keep us in suspense as to whether this immunity is absolute or presumptive, but it quickly gives up the game. It explains that, “[a]t a minimum, the President must . . . be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’” <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added). No dangers, none at all. It is hard to imagine a criminal prosecution for a President’s official acts that would pose no dangers of intrusion on Presidential authority in the majority’s eyes.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr>
    <p><em>From <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong>, dissenting, p. 12:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>the majority’s dividing line between “official” and “unofficial” conduct narrows the conduct considered “unofficial” almost to a nullity. It says that whenever the President acts in a way that is “‘not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority,’” he is taking official action. <em>Ante,</em> at 17 (quoting <em>Blassingame</em> v. <em>Trump</em>, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC 2023)). It then goes a step further: “In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” <em>Ante,</em> at 18. It is one thing to say that motive is irrelevant to questions regarding the scope of civil liability, but it is quite another to make it irrelevant to questions regarding criminal liability. Under that rule, any use of official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt purpose indicated by objective evidence of the most corrupt motives and intent, remains official and immune. Under the majority’s test, if it can be called a test, the category of Presidential action that can be deemed “unofficial” is destined to be vanishingly small.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong>, dissenting, pp. 29-30:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Looking beyond the fate of this particular prosecution, the long-term consequences of today’s decision are stark. The Court effectively creates a law-free zone around the President, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the Founding. This new official-acts immunity now “lies about like a loaded weapon” for any President that wishes to place his own interests, his own political survival, or his own financial gain, above the interests of the Nation. <em>Korematsu</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 323 U. S. 214, 246 (1944) (Jackson, J., dissenting). The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.</p>
     <p>Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends. Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority’s message today.</p>

    <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, pp. 9-10:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Immunity can issue for Presidents under the majority’s model even for unquestionably and intentionally egregious criminal behavior. Regardless of the nature or the impact of the President’s criminal conduct, so long as he is committing crimes “pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution,” <em>ante</em>, at 7, or as needed “to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution,” <em>ante</em>, at 14, he is likely to be deemed immune from prosecution.</p>
     <p>Ultimately, the majority’s model simply sets the criminal law to one side when it comes to crimes allegedly committed by the President. Before accountability can be sought or rendered, the Judiciary serves as a newfound special gatekeeper, charged not merely with interpreting the law but with policing whether it applies to the President <em>at all</em>. Also, under the new Presidential accountability model, the starting presumption is that the criminal law does <em>not</em> apply to Presidents, no matter how obviously illegal, harmful, or unacceptable a President’s official behavior might be. Regardless of all that, courts must now ensure that a former President is <em>not</em> held accountable for any criminal conduct he engages in while he is on duty, unless his conduct consists primarily (and perhaps solely) of unofficial acts.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, p. 10:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>To fully appreciate the oddity of making the criminal immunity determination turn on the character of the President’s responsibilities, consider what the majority says is one of the President’s “conclusive and preclusive” prerogatives: “ ‘[t]he President’s power to remove . . . those who wield executive power on his behalf.’ ” <em>Ante,</em> at 8 (quoting <em>Seila Law LLC</em> v. <em>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, 591 U. S. 197, 204 (2020)). While the President may have the authority to decide to remove the Attorney General, for example, the question here is whether the President has the option to remove the Attorney General by, say, poisoning him to death. Put another way, the issue here is not whether the President has exclusive removal power, but whether a generally applicable criminal law prohibiting murder can restrict how the President exercises that authority.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, p. 11:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>under the individual accountability model, an indicted former President can raise an affirmative defense just like any other criminal defendant. This means that the President remains answerable to the law, insofar as he must show that he was justified in committing a criminal act while in office under the given circumstances. In other words, while the President might indeed be privileged to commit a crime in the course of his official duties, any such privilege exists only when the People (acting either through their elected representatives or as members of a jury) determine that the former President’s conduct was in fact justified, notwithstanding the general criminal prohibition.</p>
     <p>Under the majority’s immunity regime, by contrast, the President can commit crimes in the course of his job even under circumstances <em>in which no one thinks he has any excuse</em>; the law simply does not apply to him. Unlike a defendant who invokes an affirmative defense and relies on a legal determination that there was a good reason for his otherwise unlawful conduct, a former President invoking immunity relies on the premise that he can do whatever he wants, however he wants, so long as he uses his “‘official power’” in doing so. <em>Ante,</em> at 19. In the former paradigm, the President remains subject to law; in the latter, he is above it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, pp. 13-14:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>whatever additional power the majority’s new Presidential accountability model gives to the Presidency, it gives doubly to the Court itself, for the majority provides no meaningful guidance about how to apply this new paradigm or how to categorize a President’s conduct. For instance, its opinion lists some examples of the “core” constitutional powers with respect to which the President is now entitled to absolute immunity—a list that apparently includes the removal power, the power to recognize foreign nations, and the pardon power. <em>Ante,</em> at 6–9. However, the majority does not—and likely cannot—supply any useful or administrable definition of the scope of that “core.” For what it’s worth, the Constitution’s text is no help either; Article II does not contain a Core Powers Clause. So the actual metes and bounds of the “core” Presidential powers are really anyone’s guess.</p>
     <p>Nor does the majority explain how to consistently distinguish between official and unofficial acts. Quite the opposite, in fact. While acknowledging that this is a critical line that courts must draw in order for its new accountability model to work properly, the majority simultaneously cautions that making this distinction “can be difficult”—likely a gross understatement given the recognized “breadth of the President’s ‘discretionary responsibilities’ under the Constitution and laws of the United States.” <em>Ante,</em> at 17.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, p. 15:</em></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>while Congress (the branch of our Government most accountable to the People) is the entity our Constitution tasks with deciding, as a general matter, what conduct is on or off limits, the Court has now arrogated that power unto itself when that question pertains to the President. In essence, the Court has now imposed its own preclearance requirement on the application of Congress’s laws to a former President alleged to have committed crimes while in office. Who will be responsible for drawing the crucial “‘line between [the President’s] personal and official affairs’”? <em>Ante,</em> at 29. To ask the question is to know the answer. A majority of this Court, applying an indeterminate test, will pick and choose which laws apply to which Presidents, by labeling his various allegedly criminal acts as “core,” “official,” or “manifestly or palpably” beyond the President’s authority.</p>

    <p>An apology for the <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-enabling-act">Enabling Act</a> that the Supreme Court has <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">judicially inserted into American law</a> goes like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>By prosecuting a former President, Democrats opened a Pandora's Box under which every ex-President would be prosecuted by their rivals upon retirement, crippling the office, and discouraging high-quality candidates from seeking it. The Supreme Court had to prevent this.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Let's say this was your honest concern, and you are John Roberts.</p>
    <p>You are not trying to render the Executive unaccountable. You want accountability, but some form of accountability that would deter routine political show trials of each party's highest-profile figure, prosecuted by the opposing party.</p>
    <p>That might be a reasonable goal.</p>
    <p>But if it really was your goal to deter "lawfare" while keeping the Executive Branch lawful, the decision you craft would look nothing like <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>.</p>
    <p>Sure, you might grant pretty broad immunity to the President, as this decision does.</p>
    <p>But you would not grant impenetrable deference to the President's pardon power. You would <em>encourage</em>, rather than prohibit, judicial inquiry into the motivation for pardons. Pardons for crimes ordered or encouraged or intended to serve the interest of the President would be invalid.</p>
    <p>The President would still be immune. His <em>subordinates</em>, however, would not be. His suboordinates would still have reason to refuse unlawful orders. At the very least, they would demand legal cover before following deeply questionable commands. (Just as <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/2014-06-23_barron-memorandum.pdf">Obama did</a>, before icing a US citizen in a drone strike.)</p>
    <p>This is the accountabilty equilibrium we created after the Nixon Administration. Yes, Ford pardoned Nixon. Nixon got to live the rest of his days as a free man, even an <em>eminence grise</em>.</p>
    <p>But many of his subordinates were imprisoned — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Haldeman">H. R. Haldeman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman">John Ehrlichman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Colson">Charles Colson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_N._Mitchell">John Mitchell</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Gordon_Liddy">G. Gordon Liddy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._McCord_Jr.">James W. McCord Jr.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dean">John Dean</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Chapin">Dwight Chapin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_W._Kalmbach">Herbert Kalmbach</a>.</p>
    <p>Had <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> been the law in 1972, all of these men could have been peremptorily pardoned. No judicial inquiry could have been made into the motivations for those pardons. No criminal liability could attach to the President for making them. No subpeonas could penetrate a hermetic wall of silence, since any contempt charges could be pardoned as well.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> doesn't just grant the President immunity. It takes the heavily litigated notion of "executive privilege", renders it unjudiciable, and extends it as far and wide as the President wishes to extend it — with no remedy, no consideration of other interests, no hope ever of piercing it.</p>
    <p>In its own words, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> is about encouraging "bold", "unhesitating", "energetic", "vigorous" action by the President. John Roberts could have sought to balance the public's interest in an effective Executive with the public's interest that the President "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed". He could have whispered into the Constitution the post-Richard-Nixon balance. He chose not to.</p>
    <p>John Roberts and his henchmen are very familiar with this history. What they instead chose to whisper into the Constitution was a <em>remedy</em> for the accountability that the Nixon administration faced. They chose quite deliberately not merely to immunize the President, but to create an unaccountable Executive, whose breadth is as wide and encompassing as the President chooses by exercise of his power to pardon.</p>

    <p>The United States is no longer a liberal democracy.</p>
    <p>As of Monday, July 1st, 2024 and the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>, the United States fails liberal democracy's most basic test. Citizens no longer have rights against the state that cannot be abrogated without due process, because presidential prerogatives are granted priority above due process and rendered immune from challenge by the courts.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court has legislated a loophole through the constraints on presidential power that is so large, so conveniently and readily accessible, that all notional limits to government power can be circumvented by a determined President, with almost no risk of being held accountable.</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, the decision claims that the President has "conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority" over <s>"commanding the Armed Forces of the United States" and</s> "pardons for offenses against the United States".</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>[T]he nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>(See <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/#no-longer-a-liberal-democracy-update-2024-07-07">update below</a>.)</em></p>
    <p>A President, the decision pretends, remains accountable for "unofficial acts". For "official acts" beyond his "conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority", the President enjoys "at least a presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility."</p>
    <p>In theory, this "presumptive immunity" can be rebutted, overcome, but</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such a “highly intrusive” inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose... Nor may courts deem an action unofficial merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This decision is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-says-the-presidents-power-will-not-be-questioned/2017/02/13/0f772184-f14f-11e6-9fb1-2d8f3fc9c0ed_video.html">Stephen Miller</a>, translated into legalese:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Our opponents, the media, and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions that the powers of the President... are very substantial and will not be questioned. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Commanding the armed forces plus the pardon power, if unaccountable and unreviewable, are sufficient to impose dictatorship.</p>
    <p>"Can't you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something?", Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1097517470/trump-esper-book-defense-secretary">asked</a> of General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley, when protesters gathered at the White House following the killing of George Floyd.</p>
    <p>Their answer, of course, was no. If Trump had ordered them to do so, it would have been an unlawful order, and they would have refused. If he insisted, he would have risked imprisonment. If they had acted, so would they.</p>
    <p>Today, if a President orders the armed forces to shoot at protesters, it would still be an unlawful order. <s>But Trump would enjoy absolute, unreviewable, immunity for giving it.</s> But Trump would enjoy "at least presumptive immunity", and perhaps absolute immunity, for giving it. If the order was made informally, in the context of discussions with the subordinates with whom he collaborates in official acts, the decision renders it extraordiarily unlikely any judicial process could intervene to discover it.</p>
    <p>It would still be unlawful for his subordinates to act upon the order. But the President could promise to pardon subordinates who act. He could fire subordinates who refuse. The decision places both the pardon power and the President's "unrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates" beneath a shield of absolute immunity.</p>
    <p>Obviously, this would be, should be, illegitimate. A President is required by the Constitution to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" as much as he is empowered as Commander-in-Chief. But on Monday, the Supreme Court plainly and explicitly placed the latter before the former.</p>
    <p>Shooting a bunch of protesters "in the legs" is small potatoes. Anything the armed forces of the United States might conceivably do the President can order. Any legal restraints that might bind his subordinates, the President can pardon. Conscientious resistors can be fired, detained, made to go through some things.</p>
    <p>Even if the Federal government cannot, might not states prosecute generals and soldiers who injure, kidnap, or kill? The President's pardon power does not reach state law.</p>
    <p>This strikes me as a pretty thin read on which to place ones hopes. Good luck enforcing arrest warrants against members of the US military for following the President's orders. Good luck preventing the President from having the armed forces detain any prosecutors or judges determined to produce them.</p>
    <p>From Sonia Sotomayor's dissenting opinion:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Obviously, it is more essential now than it was a week ago that we not elect Donald Trump to a second term. But the identity of the President is not the problem here. Here's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling/">Joe Biden</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>You know, at the outset of our nation, it was the character of George Washington, our first president, that defined the presidency. He believed power was limited, not absolute, and that power would always reside with the people — always.</p>
     <p>Now, over 200 years later, with today’s Supreme Court decision, once again it will depend on the character of the men and women who hold that presidency that are going to define the limits of the power of the presidency, because the law will no longer do it.</p>
     <p>I know I will respect the limits of the presidential power, as I have for three and a half years. But any president, including Donald Trump, will now be free to ignore the law.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It's not about Donald Trump. United States Presidents are usually not of great character. It takes tremendous ambition, and a certain degree of sociopathy, to win a prize as coveted and valuable as that office. Every President must be willing to do things that the less sociopathic among us would struggle to live with. Even just and necessary military action imposes misery and death on people who do not deserve it, who bear no fault.</p>
    <p>Donald Trump is bad. Barack Obama repudiated prohibitions against assassination that were table stakes for the "good guys" when I grew up, and simply <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2255.html">normalized the practice</a>. At least Obama was sufficiently chastened by risks of accountability that he had the Office of Legal Counsel <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/2014-06-23_barron-memorandum.pdf">perform a thorough analysis</a> before he assassinated a US citizen. (They said it was okay.) Joe Biden has to his great credit <a href="https://theweek.com/foreign-policy/1007579/biden-nearly-ended-the-drone-war-and-nobody-noticed">largely ceased</a> America's drone assassination programs.</p>
    <p>Should we have trusted the character of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to protect our rights? The character of Bill Clinton? Richard Nixon? A rights regime that depends upon the character of the President is not a rights regime at all. Whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else, the ring of power that the Supreme Court has forged will do its work of tempting tyranny and atrocity. There are always crises, and in crises, anything seems justified. The scandal becomes failing to exploit the tools you have at hand.</p>
    <p>If the United States is to be a liberal democracy, this (legally <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-v-united-states-opinion-chief-roberts/678877/">shoddy</a>) decision must be reversed. Since the majority at the Supreme Court claims their coup is embedded in the Constitution itself, Congress is helpless to directly reverse it.</p>
    <p>John Roberts has always presented himself as an institutionalist. He is not an institutionalist. On Monday, John Roberts did far more damage to America's instituions than Donald Trump did on January 6.</p>
    <p>In the post <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> era — a decision we must now also revisit — only the Supreme Court can undo the work that it does when it speaks <em>ex cathedra</em> for the Constitution itself.</p>
    <p>I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7964.html">have been an advocate</a> for Supreme Court reform that strives not to be overtly political. I've sought procedures that would prevent factional misuse of the Court, rather than advance my own faction's views. Rather than expand or "pack" the Court, I have argued we should "merge the Court", to have its work be done by the full Federal apellate bench, with panels that hear individual cases chosen by lot. I still think that's a good approach.</p>
    <p>But this Court has created a crisis. The scandal becomes failing to exploit the tools you have at hand. It is to Joe Biden's deep discredit that, when pressed for Supreme Court reform, he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/pcscotus/">commissioned a study</a> and then did nothing with it.</p>
    <p>We are in a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/is-this-the-wile-e-coyote-moment/">Wile-E-Coyote moment</a>. The cliff has gone out from beneath our feet, but we have not yet fallen. The awful powers latent in the Supreme Court's decision have not yet been abused to crush democracy, but inevitably, inevitably, they will, if they remain as this Supreme Court has defined them.</p>
    <p>If the possibility is not permanently foreclosed on November 5, if by the grace of God alone we get another shot, we need to pack the court ASAP, and then generate a test case under which this calamity of a decision will be overturned. Normalizing court-packing is not great, but it's the only check the other branches currently have when the Supreme Court consitutionalizes atrocity.</p>
    <p>Once this awful decision has been relegated to history, I hope that we do restructure the Court to make it structurally less susceptible to serving as a tool for factional mischief. I hope that we do revisit — and temper rather than eliminate — <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>.</p>
    <p>But that is all for the future. The Supreme Court set the world aflame on Monday. If you haven't noticed the heat, if you don't notice the blisters already forming on your skin very soon, then we are all going to burn.</p>

     <p><strong>Update 2024-07-07:</strong> <span id="no-longer-a-liberal-democracy-update-2024-07-07"> Today I sat for a careful read of the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">full packet of syllabus and decision and concurrences and dissents</a> issued by the Supreme Court for <em>Trump v. United States</em>.</span></p>
     <p>In my origial piece, I erred when I claimed the majority named "commanding the Armed Forces of the United States" a "conclusive and preclusive" power of the President.</p>
     <p>The majority cites "commanding the Armed Forces" in the following context:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>Article II of the Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” §1, cl. 1. The President’s duties are of “unrivaled gravity and breadth.” Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 800 (2020). They include, for instance, commanding the Armed Forces of the United States; granting reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States; and appointing public ministers and consuls, the Justices of this Court, and Officers of the United States.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>But the decision later says of Presidential authority derived from explicit enumeration in the Constitution that it is only "<em>sometimes</em> 'conclusive and preclusive'". (My emphasis.)</p>
     <p>The decision does explicitly place the pardon power among as among the President's conclusive and preclusive authorities. But I was wrong to assert that it places "commanding the Armed Forces" under its new, automatic and unreviewable, absolute immunity category. It might! It might not!</p>
     <p>"Commanding the armed forces" is definitely an official act, and as such the decision grants an immunity that is "at least presumptive" and perhaps absolute:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>At least with respect to the President’s exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for his remaining official actions, he is also entitled to immunity. At the current stage of proceedings in this case, however, we need not and do not decide whether that immunity must be absolute, or instead whether a presumptive immunity is sufficient.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>The Court has not decided yet whether commanding the armed forces is a "core constitutional power", or whether <em>all</em> of a President's official actions enjoy immunity absolute immunity.</p>
     <p>Suppose we are lucky, and commanding the armed forces is subject only to "at least presumptive immunity".</p>
     <p>As Justice Jackson emphasizes,</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>The majority... provides no guidance as to when, how, or why the President’s “presumptive” immunity for noncore official acts might be rebutted, saying only that applying the criminal law to a President’s acts must pose “no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’”</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Justice Jackson views the majority as basically placing any criminal accountability for a President's official acts at the discretion of the Supreme Court. She also emphasizes that the complex gating procedure the decision enshirines renders any criminal accountability of a President much more unlikely and uncertain than it had been previously, diminishing the deterrent to bad acts criminal accountability is supposed to provide.</p>
     <p>Justice Sotomayor is even more pessimistic about any prospect of Presidential accountability at all under the decision.</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>Whether described as presumptive or absolute, under the majority’s rule, a President’s use of any official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt, is immune from prosecution. That is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless...</p>
      <p>The majority purports to keep us in suspense as to whether this immunity is absolute or presumptive, but it quickly gives up the game. It explains that, “[a]t a minimum, the President must . . . be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose <em>no ‘dangers of intrusion</em> on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’” <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added). No dangers, none at all. It is hard to imagine a criminal prosecution for a President’s official acts that would pose no dangers of intrusion on Presidential authority in the majority’s eyes.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>I am glad that "commanding the Armed Forces of the United States" has not yet been adjudicated to be — or not to be — a "core constitutional authority" already protected by absolutely immunity. It's current status is <em>at least presumptively immune but perhaps absolutely immune</em>, with how one would, or whether one could, pierce and rebut presumptive immunity not defined.</p>
     <p>I can't say I'll be sleeping much easier.</p>
     <p>Let's let Justice Thomas have the last word:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>In this case, there has been much discussion about ensuring that a President “is not above the law.” But, as the Court explains, the President’s immunity from prosecution for his official acts <em>is</em> the law.</p>
     </blockquote>

    <p>Perhaps Joe Biden is not so determined to be the Democratic Party's candidate for President. If that is the case, you may never, ever know it.</p>
    <p>As old and stumbling as Joe Biden may have appeared on the debate stage, the Biden <em>Administration</em> has comported itself with tremendous intelligence. Should it entertain a change of leadership, let's imagine that it will do so with the same intelligence. What would that look like?</p>
    <p>First, over the next few weeks, expect any possibility of a change of leadership to be mocked, rejected, completely ruled out, in every public communication. This weekend's mini rebellion among pundits and Democratic Party has-beens will be crushed. Joe Biden may be too old, he may not be the candidate we'd want to save democracy itself, but he will be the only candidate we have.</p>
    <p>All of us who do not want a second Trump administration will fall back into line. He has, in fact, been the best domestic policy President since Lyndon Johnson. Compare him to the alternative, not the almighty, we will say. It is not the doddering old man we are electing, but the remarkable administration that has somehow conjured itself around him.</p>
    <p>It won't be an easy sell to politically detached swing voters, who <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">decide</a> US Presidential elections. A personal or symbolic connection to an imagined heroic leader may be more accessible to those voters than arcana like this adminstration's remarkable <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/lina-m-khan">FTC</a>, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/bidens-nlrb-restoring-rights/">NLRB</a>, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/10/getting-things-done/#deliverism">CFPB</a>, or its <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan">SAVE plan</a>. Nevertheless the excellence of the administration's accomplishments will have the benefit of being true, and it will be all we have.</p>
    <p>Why, if Biden is considering withdrawing, will his administration completely rule out the possibility of withdrawing? Because if there is continued, credible, will-he-won't-he chatter, that will weaken him and render his continued candidacy less tenable. And in order to successfully withdraw, he must withdraw from a position of strength rather than weakness within the Democratic Party firmament. Any succession must be a negotiated succession, and Joe Biden is his own <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/what-is-batna/">BATNA</a>.</p>
    <p>As the Biden Administration quietly discusses a potential replacement ticket, ambitious strivers will try to preen and threaten their way onto it. It must always be credible for the administration just to walk away and stick with Plan A. Disappointed shadow candidates may be tempted to appeal to the public, via their duly elected representatives on the opinion pages of <em>The New York Times</em>. The administration must make clear that its response to such perfidy would be to shut the whole thing down and double-down on Joe Biden's status as the default and inevitable Democratic nominee for President.</p>
    <p>The stupidest idea widely mooted is for an "open convention". Obviously, pundits love the idea. We can have a dramatic, fast-paced horserace to supplant this current one, which smells like mothballs and stale poop. But just because a game show is good television does not mean it is a good way to choose a nominee.</p>
    <p>An "open convention" would have no meaningful democratic legitimacy. No one actually voted for the delegates who will appear at the Democratic Party convention. Democrats voted for whoever was pledged to Joe Biden. Which particular humans show up on the convention floor is determined by processes that are not meaningfully democratic. Those processes may seem "random", but they are not, they have all kinds of systematic biases towards certain kinds of enthusiasts and operatives not remotely representative of Democratic Party rank-and-file. Choice by convention delegates is not some defensible sort of <a href="https://equalitybylot.com/introduction-to-sortition-government-by-jury/">sortition</a> by the back door.</p>
    <p>The only person with any democratic mandate to choose a successor to Joe Biden as Democratic Party nominee is Joe Biden himself, who won a Democratic Party primary open to the public at-large.</p>
    <p>Putting aside endlessly contestable arguments about legitimacy, the whole point of switching horses is risk management. The only reason Joe Biden would and should step down is if he is sure his replacement would have a much stronger shot of winning the general election. Throwing the dice on an unpredictable disorganized contest, one that might become bitterly divisive and even inspire rioting or violence at a Chicago Democratic Party convention, does not meet that bar.</p>
    <p>By the time of the convention, the identity of the Democratic nominee will be a <em>fait accompli</em>. Not-really-elected delegates will not decide, and should not decide. There are two supedelegates. They will decide.</p>
    <p>The first superdelegate, of course, is Joe Biden himself. The second superdelegate is Kamala Harris. No change of ticket can occur without Harris' enthusiastic endorsement.</p>
    <p>One way to win her endorsement is to put Harris at the head of the ticket. That might be a reasonable option! But observers underestimate Harris by presuming that she herself — me! me! me! — is the only alternative candidate that she would endorse. Harris ran in a Presidential primary, and withdrew quickly when she realized the electoral stars would not align for her.</p>
    <p>The Biden-<i>Harris</i> Administration will study the politics of potential tickets as best it can. There may be some degree of bias, some tendency to overestimate the strengths and underestimate the deficiencies of a Harris-led ticket. But <em>some</em> degree of bias will be a limited degree of bias. If the Biden-Harris Administration comes internally to a conclusion that a different candidate would have a much stronger shot, Harris is not such an egotist that she will risk throwing the country to Donald Trump in exchange for a lottery ticket to become President. Of course, Harris will negotiate a cabinet position for herself, or a quiet promise of favorable consideration should a vacancy arise on the Supreme Court. But she will not stand implacably in the way of whomever the administration determines to be the strongest contender.</p>
    <p>The most likely outcome of all of this is just what it was before the miserable debate. Most likely, the general election will be a contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Biden might be implacably opposed to stepping down. Or, he may be open to the idea, but this delicate, Democratic-Party-internal dance to annoint a credible successor might break down. Some narcissist the administration decides against could take his case to the opinion pages. If there's too much of that, the administration will fall back to the inevitable and deny it ever seriously considered making a change.</p>
    <p>But if ambitious Democrats prove willing to abide a discreet selection process, it is quite possible that the only two people who can choose their successor will do so.</p>
    <p>Paradoxically, the more inevitable a Biden-Harris ticket comes to seem over the next few weeks, the more possible the emergence of an alternative becomes. But in no case is it very likely.</p>

    <p>Since I <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">tussled</a> — gently I hope! — with <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/">Ned Resnikoff</a>, who is Policy Director of California YIMBY, I want to give credit where it is due.</p>
    <p>California YIMBY <a href="https://cayimby.org/news-events/statement-in-support-of-the-east-solano-plan/">recently came out in favor</a> of the "East Solano Plan", which is bureaucratese for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-forever-promises-new-solano-county-investments/"><em>California Forever</em></a>.</p>
    <p>As I said <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">before</a>, I favor that project, and wish it every success.</p>
    <p>I am delighted to see CA YIMBY back dense, greenfield development at scale. I think it is the only approach that can match the enormity of our housing problem, a catastrophe that renders life insecure and dystopian for nearly all of us not sitting on equity from a home bought years ago.</p>
    <p>I think ultimately it will <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/07/only-the-state-can-house-us/index.html">take an activist state</a> to jumpstart and "derisk" this project of building new, dense places, in order for it to happen at sufficient scale, and in a diversity of places, not within just superstar metros. Resnikoff <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/p/yimbys-proving-fatalists-wrong">disagrees</a>. Regardless of who is right or wrong in that debate, I am delighted that we share an enthusiasm for dense habitations built on "greenfields", rather than just "infill" development of already inhabited places.</p>
    <p>I know that it is <a href="https://x.com/cafedujord/status/1803290168331489303">difficult</a> <a href="https://x.com/bhargreaves/status/1803491835530133756">for</a> <a href="https://x.com/mnolangray/status/1803322692256584048">California YIMBY</a> to take this position, because most YIMBY activism has been devoted to reforming land-use regulation in support of infill development. Many YIMBYs consider greenfield development inherently "sprawl", an enemy to good, green urbanism.</p>
    <p>I think California YIMBY is right. Dense development is green development, almost wherever it is. It's the density that matters, not the where.</p>
    <p>There are roughly 340 million people in the United States. All of them need to be housed. The "footprint" of that housing, in terms of simple land area, land that can be neither wilderness nor farmland, is solely a function of average density. At suburban densities — call it 2000 humans per square mile — we require 170,000 square miles for our habitat. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density&amp;oldid=1229928813">Paris density</a>, the same 340M people could be accommodated on less than 7000 square miles.</p>
    <p>Density is overwhelmingly the factor that divides green from less-green development. Besides raw land area used, people live more efficiently and ecologically when they live densely. In a suburb you drive to your errands. In a dense city you walk or take transit. There are economies of scale in distribution and infrastructure, especially if you can plan in advance rather than suffering the economic and human costs of retrofitting.</p>
    <p>An exception is when residents would have to commute long distances. But more and more work can be done remotely, or distributed to local offices. People don't like to commute! New residents of new cities will sort themselves, and be disproportionately people who can work in or near their new homes, rather than schlep to some distant city center. Of course it would be great if we built trains to make any schlepping ecological and convenient! But we shouldn't hold our new-city-ing hostage to that. One thing at a time is how anything actually happens.</p>
    <p>Yes, it is great, when we can, to build densely near existing centers of on-site employment. All else equal, such housing that can serve a greater variety of people at lower environmental cost. But wherever we build, if we build densely and at sufficient scale to amortize the cost of urban amenities, we will dramatically reduce both our geographical footprint and the environmental weight of our lifestyles.</p>
    <p>Dense living does not imply cramped living. If we build at midrise or higher, we can accommodate Barcelona to Manhattan densities with generously sized apartments. The elevator is an underrated form of transit.</p>
    <p>Human beings are clever, and people <a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/the-5-coolest-trends-in-urbanism">have gotten very good</a>, especially in Europe and Asia, at planning and building dense, extremely desirable places to live.</p>
    <p>That's the prize.</p>
    <p>We can do it too! And we don't have to confine the work to the geographies where it is hardest to do, to places already inhabited at moderate densities whose residents understandably get grumpy when we come in with our bright eyes to reconfigure their worlds.</p>
    <p>California YIMBY is doing the right thing on the East Solana Plan. However we organize and finance it all, the way we address America's housing <em>and</em> ecological problems at their actual scale is building new dense communities in places now only lightly inhabited.</p>

    <p>One of the drivers of authoritarianism is a sense we just can't get anything done, that solving our multiplying polycrises demands a strongman who can break through the gridlock, get everybody moving in the same direction, actually do stuff.</p>
    <p>It's easy to be antiauthoritarian because you think the wannabe authoritarians are fascists, white supremicists, Christian nationalists, assholes. That's largely true!</p>
    <p>But if your pro-democracy activism is centered around opposing these easy evils, you are countering the weakest rather than the strongest arguments of your opponents. You might or might not win the narrow political squeakers that our electoral system now sets up, but you won't persuade the bulk of the public to any new consensus. And without a new consensus, well, eventually one of these most important elections of our lifetime will be lost, and perhaps that will be that.</p>
    <p>It is in fact correct and true that solving our muliplying polycrises demands a state capable of overcoming narrow vetoes and forging some broad consensus that can break through the gridlock, get most of us moving in the same direction, actually do stuff.</p>
    <p>If you believe in electoral democracy as a <em>practical</em> rather than merely desirable system of government, then you must believe that it is possible for a democratic state to recruit sufficient alignment to meet the challenges that the polity faces.</p>
    <p>If you think that's going to happen by "our side" definitively winning and simply banishing the other side to perpetual marginality, well, that is also what we think that they will do to us. So long as that's the plan, each side will think of themselves as the anti-authoritarian side. Nothing will change, or, even worse, something will.</p>
    <p>If we want <em>genuinely democratic</em> state capacity, state capacity that does not rely on disenfranchising much of the country, we have to address the institutional factors that favor polarization rather than consensus.</p>
    <p>We have to <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7828.html">move past a narrow majoritarianism</a> — which is a much weaker basis for democratic legitimacy than proponents on "our side" often pretend — towards a system in which most of the public feels on-board, rather than either winning or shut out.</p>
    <p>If Democrats are really pro-democracy, they have to do more than argue only reelecting them can save democracy. They must bequeath to the public a system in which citizens actually have meaningful choices, rather than cling to and capitalize on an <em>it's-us-or-Adolf</em> dynamic. Are Democrats pro-democracy, or just pro conditions that help them win their next election?</p>
    <p>The reforms I favor Congress could pass in a day. Elections for single-winner, at-large positions like Senator and President should be by <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">approval voting</a>, which favors candidates everyone can live with over candidates that members of conflictual factions most ardently support, and which encourages the emergence of multiple parties. Elections to the House of Representative should be by some form of proportional representation, whether it's my unlikely dorky favorite (<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7043.html">random ballot</a>), a conventional party-list based system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single-transferable-vote</a>, or the clever hybrid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">MMP</a>.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you have different reforms in mind. This is a democracy! But you are not objectively pro-democracy if you are not working to reform a system that, by virtue of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">widely understood social dynamics</a>, will predictably, recurringly, almost inevitably, yield polarization, gridlock, and incapacity.</p>
    <p>States are the <em>sine qua non</em> of human capability. A certain kind of libertarian might resent this, but it's obviously true. Human achievement and flourishing stratify across borders, favoring states that act and act well over states incapable of acting or that act poorly.</p>
    <p>In a different era, when communication technology had not so completely tamed geography, the deficiencies of the US political system were <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">kept in check</a> by the diversity of an all-politics-is-local world.</p>
    <p>Now all politics is national. Dysfunction latent in our arrangements has emerged, a blister burst, a festival of maggots dancing in the wound. We're not going to uninvent the internet. Our national state will yield little but polarization, gridlock, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pay_auction">all-pay auctions</a> in favor of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7759.html">political consultants</a>, until we change the institutions that structure it.</p>
    <p>We <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/13/yimboree/index.html">need state capacity</a> now more than ever. We can do better than succumb to authoritarianism or <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/bourne/1918/war-is-the-health-of-the-state.html">gin up some war</a> to find it.</p>
    <p>But we <em>will</em> do one of those things if we don't do anything else to restore a capable state.</p>
    <p>Electoral reform is possible. It is easy. Nothing is more urgent, or more hopeful.</p>

    <p>Ned Resnikoff offers a <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/p/yimbys-proving-fatalists-wrong">great rejoinder</a> to my <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/07/only-the-state-can-house-us/index.html">recent piece</a>, <em>Only the state can house us</em>. Go read it if you haven't!</p>
    <p>Lots of places in that piece, I felt like Resnikoff didn't have an accurate understanding of my position. That's my fault, not his. I thought I'd try to clarify.</p>
    <p>First a narrow thing. Resnikoff writes</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>What’s instead needed — in fact, what he describes as “an inevitability” — is a massive social housing program that will create millions of government-owned, government-subsidized housing units across the country.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That isn't quite right. I don't propose some giant unified "social program", and I don't propose that housing units should necessarily remain government-owned.</p>
    <p>I propose — and yes, I do think quite inevitable — a much more <em>dirigiste</em> approach to housing. The state would subsidize development of new communities in places and under terms private business otherwise would not invest. Call it a CHIPS Act for new cities.</p>
    <p>I hope we would experiment with a variety of models, from the Singapore model — basically sales of publicly developed homes to residents — to "<a href="https://citymonitor.ai/environment/housing/red-vienna-how-austrias-capital-earned-its-place-in-housing-history">Red Vienna</a>"-style rentals from a municipal corporation. But I believe we need new cities built in greenfields, not just liberalized infill of already desirable places, in order to meet the housing challenges that we currently face, and the much more difficult challenges that await us. I think we will require an interventionist state.</p>
    <p>If you want more specifics on the kind of development I'd propose, please see <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8772.html"><em>Microcities</em></a>.</p>
    <p>Resnikoff does not comment on the reason I give <em>why</em> state-led housing production is inevitable. We are already in a miserable housing affordability crisis. I argue that forseeable climate events are likely to provoke migrations and shortages at a different scale than moving-to-amenity price-bidding has thus far.</p>
    <p>I wonder, does Resnikoff agree or disagree that this is at least a plausible scenario? If it happens, our housing problem is going to feel less like today's growth ill-accommodated, and more like wartime logistics. <em>That's</em> why state action is inevitable. We can either develop capabilities within the state to superintend construction of high-quality, dense, mixed-use communities, or we can fail to do so, and then build slapdash, utilitarian, barrack communities that will remain people's homes for years if not lifetimes.</p>
    <p>I think it's urgent that we develop state capacity to endow high quality new communities quickly and at scale, <em>now</em>, so that we know it as a practical thing when the crisis comes and overwhelms us. The alternative will become a terrible scar to our body politic, slums for millions of people. And if we are going to start building new communities now, to develop this state capacity, why not make it an alternative to the NIMBY-YIMBY trench wars?</p>
    <p>In general, I think Resnikoff read my piece as more of a broadside against YIMBY than I intended. I'd characterize myself as YIMBY-skeptical or YIMBY-critical. But that's not the same as anti-YIMBY (or NIMBY, or PHIMBY, or whatever).</p>
    <p>People who share a lot of values often disagree more bitterly than people who are more straightforward adversaries. Betrayal is a crueler cut than enmity.</p>
    <p>I share a lot of values with YIMBYs!</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>I agree with YIMBYs that housing scarcity in desirable places to live is the signal domestic crisis of our time. We can't fix anything if we don't restore housing abundance in safe, lively, places with good schools that offer residents a high quality of life.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>For a lot of reasons, I agree with YIMBY visions of urbanism. Exurban McMansions may offer some residents a high quality of life, but in ways that cannot possibly scale and are necessarily exclusive. Dense mixed-use development is what does scale, is (contra some green intuitions) the way to house large numbers of humans with a light environmental footprint and also with the greatest joy, if it is done well. In a good future, the majority of humans live at near-Manhattan densities, and car travel is for trips, not for everyday life. That's best for human flourishing, and best for the planet.</p>
      <p>"Done well" is an important caveat! Density is a magnifying glass, both for social virtue and for social vice. Bad density is very bad. But excellent, delightful, dense development is a tractible sociotechnical problem. They build out <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2024/03/05/seestadt-aspern-housing-berger-parkkinen-vienna-social-housing-revival/">little</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-25/nordhavn-in-copenhagen-is-the-future-of-sustainable-urban-planning">utopias</a> in Europe all the time.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I disagree with YIMBYs about some important things too.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>As a matter of tactics, I think that focusing on infill rather than greenfield densification is a big mistake. For all the reasons described <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/07/only-the-state-can-house-us/index.html">in my prior piece</a> — what Resnikoff <a href="https://resnikoff.beehiiv.com/p/yimbys-proving-fatalists-wrong">characterizes</a> as "futility theses" — I don't think that infill densification in already desirable places will come anywhere close to matching the scale of the problem.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>As a matter of ethics, even though I agree with YIMBY ends, I have problems with their means. I think they often understate and deny the costs of the changes they propose to incumbent residents. I think the people they often mock as NIMBYs have understandable reasons for the positions they take, motivations that merit social and political respect. Left YIMBYs sometimes suggest that what they propose is a kind of redistribution. (Matt Yglesias once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222055850/https://tinyletter.com/mattyglesias/letters/what-s-driving-me-is-driving-you">described</a> the YIMBY project as "as 'radical land reform' in the sense of the Latin American left.") I'm for a lot of redistribution, but I think we all can understand that when redistributing, questions about from whom, to whom, how it is proposed to be done, how it will actually work out in practice, are really important.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These two critiques are mutually reinforcing. One reason I think infill densification in already desirable places is tactically challenging is because achieving it often involves threatening perhaps the most intimate and powerful circumstance of peoples' lives, their homes and neighborhoods. Some people are filthy rich and who cares if they don't like the new development they can move. But most Americans struggle to afford housing in safe, desirable, lively places. When they have done so, when they have achieved that dream, it becomes the anchor of, and usually the crowning economic achievement of, their lives. Many households have devoted years of energy and volunteerism to maintaining and improving neighborhoods the market now finds so desirable.</p>
    <p>In poorer commuinities, the rentals might not be a crowning economic achievement, but most of people's "wealth" takes the form of easily disruptible, informal social capital. Wealthier reformers don't even perceive this, because they are accustomed to meeting their needs primarily through the market and perhaps insurance from immediate family. But busting up a neighborhood, with all its informal connections and friendships, its habits of help, people who owe and are owed one, is, as a wise man once said, a big fucking deal. This sort of displacement can be a terrible redistribution away from the already poor.</p>
    <p>For all of these reasons — <em>futility</em>, I know! — residents of existing neighborhoods, of every social class, have very powerful reasons to seek to exercise control over whether and how their neighborhoods change. Tactically, fighting against that seems like it should be a last rather than first resort, if you mean to achieve housing abundance soon. Ethically, even if — <em>fuck futility!</em> — you are able to organize over the heads of, outside the boundaries of, affected neighborhoods and impose "wins" from above, well, that's good for housing abundance. But it may or may not be a net good thing. It depends.</p>
    <p>I have never understood, at some deep basal level, why a reformer would choose to go for housing abundance <em>in this way</em>. It seems to me, historically, when metropolitan areas have grown in population quickly, the unit at which change has occurred is <em>neighborhood</em> or <em>new town</em>, rather than project-by-project infill in stably settled places.</p>
    <p>My hypothesis is that we got this approach, and have kept doubling down on it, because a generation of young professionals really wanted to move to particular, already settled, places. They disliked that they either were priced out, or — to their credit! — they were not, but disliked that they were pricing out incumbent residents.</p>
    <p>It is understandable that actual people coming of age want to move to particular existing places. It does an individual little good to imagine that someday there might be other wonderful choices. But once we shift our perspective from wanderer to reformer, an imagination of what could be, of alternatives we are capable of achieving that are just a bit less adjacent to the <em>status quo</em>, strikes me as essential.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I am not "anti-YIMBY". I lived in San Francisco for eight and a half years. On controversies surrounding particular projects, I usually favored the YIMBY side. I couldn't help but notice, however, and it did upset me that almost always the fights over some ridiculous abuse of historical preservation were in the gentrifying Mission, rather than, say, in upzone-the-affluent Pacific Heights. I was very excited by <a href="https://sfocii.org/projects/hunters-point-shipyard/overview">Hunter's Point</a>, a greenfield which I hope will be developed well, because it was going to dispossess or displace no one. I was very happy to see new construction in my own Richmond district. I wish I could afford to live in it.</p>
    <p>We left San Francisco in large part because we were priced out of housing. We had a rent-stabilized apartment, thank God, but the kid was growing. Four-hundred-and-some square feet wasn't cutting it. I had to save my marriage. Now I drive infinite miles for every stupid errand in Pinellas County, Florida, rather than just strolling down Clement Street.</p>
    <p>We'd move back to SF in a second if the twelve hundred square feet we have here were more affordable. If there were a plausible, ethical way to make that happen over a relevant time horizon, I would be all for it. I think there is not, though. I think the plausible ways aren't ethical, and the ethical ways aren't plausible.</p>
    <p>Well, that's not quite right. There are the approaches YIMBYs historically haven't emphasized. If, as Resnikoff suggests, I am out-of-date on actually existing YIMBY-ism, and YIMBYs now devote part of their considerable talents to promoting dense new development on greenfields beyond the borders of existing cities, then I am very happy to stand corrected. The plausible way to create housing abundance rapidly is through new neighborhoods and new towns. The San Francisco Bay Area is full of undeveloped land.</p>
    <p>I don't love some of the backers of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-forever-promises-new-solano-county-investments/"><em>California Forever</em></a>, and I fear their stealth buyout approach to addressing holdout problems may have doomed the project. But I wish them every success. I hope the project ushers in a new age of new-town development, one pursued in a manner less adversarial to publics constituted through our imperfectly democratic state, including at the local level. Eminent domain does exist, even if the backers of this project are ideologically opposed. Some of the people involved in <em>California Forever</em> are people I knew in San Francisco as prominent YIMBYs. At that time they seemed skeptical of new-town development, fearing that in a US context it would necessarily degnerate to single-family suburbs, endless sprawl. I am very glad their views have changed and I support their current work. (Manhattanize Mare Island!)</p>
    <p>There are lots of old-school YIMBY initiatives that pass my cost-benefit test, that I support, but that I think can only help on the margin. I support "by right" construction of ADUs and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/wa-senate-passes-bill-allowing-duplexes-fourplexes-in-single-family-zones/">missing middle</a> housing, for example. Obviously it's a judgment call. I respect the residents who adamantly disagree. I have deeply mixed feelings about organizing over their heads. But my judgment is that given the low density of single-family neighborhoods and the small scale of the construction legalized, this sort of development represents a pretty limited threat to the character of those neighborhoods and the lives of the people who live there.</p>
    <p>So I support these reforms. But I still feel icky substituting my judgment about how big an imposition these laws are for residents' own. I think local government is a critical component of democracy, and would <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8654.html">prefer approaches</a> that persuade local governments by first persuading their constituents, rather than coerce local governments over the opposition of incumbent residents.</p>
    <p>In any case, I don't believe these approaches can achieve the scale or densification that our housing and environmental crises demand. Will these mostly car-served neighborhoods become garlanded by walkable amenities and public transit, once ADUs and triplexes emerge? We can hope so. Maybe my quantitative intuitions are off, my imagination too limited. But while it's <em>per se</em> good that more people will get to live in the places they'd like to live, it's <em>per se</em> bad to overrule existing residents. I have a hard time seeing these reforms impacting supply enough to dent the cost crisis, so long as so many people seek to live in a relatively small number of extraordinarily places.</p>
    <p>As I emphasized in my prior piece, I think the heart of the problem is geographic inequality. As long as so few places — the "superstar cities", a few "<a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/book/coming-apart-the-state-of-white-america-1960-2010/">super zips</a>" in other metros — are where the amenities and opportinties and safety and good schools are, we will have a whole country trying to pile into them. You really would have to Manhattanize to have any hope of accommodating that sort of demand, and that really would overthrow the character of people's neighborhoods.</p>
    <p>Resnikoff is right to point out that the YIMBY movement has gone from success to success, that it's achieved on its path more than I ever expected it would. Maybe you should just write off my judgment? Why are you even reading this?</p>
    <p>But if you are still here, I'll say again, even with YIMBYs' surprising achievements, land-use liberalization continues to strike me as an approach incapable of meeting the scale of the problem.</p>
    <p>Politicians often boast about reforms using past reforms as their baseline. Dodd-Frank, Obama reminded us, represented the toughest regulation of the financial system since the New Deal. That was true! It still left a predatory, broken, corrupt financial system in place, and our pathway toward neofeudalism undisturbed. Solutions don't need to meet the scale of low expectations from past nonsolutions. They need to meet the scale of the actual problem. YIMBY organizing has succeeded much more than history suggested or fatalists like me imagined that it would. Yet the question remains, while demand remains heavily concentrated in a few places, can supply ever match its fluctuations, even under very liberal land-use regimes, without development of new greenfields in active collaboration with the state?</p>
    <p>I don't know. Neither do you, dear reader. You know my guess. What's yours? Here's <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1540-6229.12490">the Orlando, Redfearn study I cited</a> in the previous piece, whose conclusions match my priors. Enthusiastic YIMBYs have their studies too.</p>
    <p>Here's a graph. It's rent inflation in three metros, adjusted for overall inflation. The graph will mechanically underestimate fluctuations, up and down, because the numerator is a component of the denominator. It's laggy: New rent prices fluctuate more quickly than the average rents in the CPI basket. It's quick and dirty. I've normalized everything to 100 on January 1, 2010.</p><img src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/13/yimboree/CPI-rent-over-CPI-SEA-SFO-TPA.png" width="100%">
    <p>It is very easy to explain this graph in terms of demand. The 2010s were a tech-led decade, so San Francisco and Seattle both rocket. Seattle <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/housing-tech-hub-building-17339487.php">permitted a lot more housing</a> over the period, more than three times as much in popuation-adjusted terms. (They are cities of similar size.) Their inflation-adjusted rental prices nevertheless grow in lockstep from 2012 to 2020. Seattle's price growth slightly exceeded San Francisco's, despite its much more vigorous construction. Post-pandemic, prices decline and stay declined in construction-lagging San Francisco, but, after a dip, bounce back to their highs in Seattle.</p>
    <p>Throughout the 2010s, both tech-powerhouse cities faced strong housing demand, whose price inelasticity meant Seattle's incremental new supply barely registered. Post-pandemic, tech opportunities have softened a bit in both markets, but San Francisco has been plagued in the national conversation by a persistent "drug-addled shithole" narrative while Seattle has not.</p>
    <p>So it is easy to explain these price curves from a demand perspective. From a supply perspective... not so much. Prices rose faster, and have stayed higher, in the city that permitted much more.</p>
    <p>I've also graphed my current home, the Tampa metro. Tampa's permitting rate, per population, has been <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1oXMT">comparable to Seattle or Houston</a>, but post-pandemic demand (to which my own family contributed) has made it the rent-price-growth leader of <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1oWe8">all the metros I have looked at</a>. (Fuck me.) Miami has permitted less and seen less price growth than Tampa.</p>
    <p>Permitting is not a great proxy for YIMBY land-use policy, because it is a function of demand as well as regulation. For San Francisco vs Seattle, I think we can agree that both cities faced relentlessly high-demand over the 2010s, so they're a good match for a supply-side policy comparison. If you tell me the Miami, Tampa comparison is no good because lower starting prices drew population to Tampa, which is what drew the permitting rather than any difference in land use regulation, I'll shrug and say yeah, that might be right. Nevertheless, there's always a demand story in these price graphs. You sure have to squint to tell supply stories.</p>
    <p>A counterexample might be Austin, which <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1oXMT">by the permitting numbers</a> looks like YIMBY paradise, and which is currently <a href="https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2024/02/austin-apartments-boomed-and-rents-went-down-now-some-builders-are-dismantling-the-cranes/">enjoying a delightful rent price slump</a>. Austin's rent component of CPI seems not to be available on FRED, so I can't include it in my lazy little experiment.</p>
    <p>But I think the YIMBY story is probably a big part of what's going on in Austin. My view, which is the view beautifully documented in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1540-6229.12490">the Orlando, Redfearn paper</a>, is that while metros are small, supply very often can keep up, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6487.html">because there are greenfields near demand drivers still to be developed</a>. Once greenfields are exhausted — because the city is confined to a penninsula, or because it has sprawled so far that new exurbs would be far from drivers of demand, or because regulation prevents further sprawl — then cities cannot keep up. When demand is high, prices will spike, but greenfield expansion really can help. Infill is by its nature an order of magnitude harder and slower and more expensive.</p>
    <p>YIMBYs in my experience have diverse views about "sprawl". I think the correct position is that</p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>greenfield development should be encouraged, not restricted; and</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>the political challenge is to ensure that edge-city growth takes the form of dense, mixed-use development, rather than single-family-home cul-de-sacs.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Even when supply growth can't make a dent in price, it doesn't follow that barricading supply is good policy. All that extra housing in Seattle translates to a lot more people who get to live there, people who choose living there even at high Seattle prices. That's a real benefit. But if the housing was permitted over strenuous objections of nearby residents, that betrays real costs too. Those costs and benefits are hard to quantify. My intuitions mostly side with the YIMBYs, that the benefits probably exceeded the costs. But I could be wrong, and I don't see a way out our housing catastrophe in that kind of delicate balance.</p>
    <p>I think the work we have to do is to guide demand into places we can supply at scale.</p>
    <p>Resnikoff writes</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>But the other reason is that we won’t be able to demand manage our way out of population growth in superstar cities. We already tried that in the second half of the twentieth century when we downzoned San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York to cap population growth. How did that work out?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Despite our miscommunications, I think Resnikoff understands that merely capping supply in places with lots of demand is not a form of "demand management" I would propose or support.</p>
    <p>But we have never tried to manage demand by using state power intentionally, to endow attractive new communities, and then to subsidize amenities, opportunities, and relationships under which agglomeration effects will likely take hold, bootstrapping "natural" demand.</p>
    <p>Does Resnikoff think this impossible? Does he have a "futility thesis" of his own?</p>

    <p>Joe Biden is the best domestic-policy president of my lifetime.</p>
    <p>I wasn't expecting that, but his administration has <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/11/30/obama-was-the-most-destructive-political-figure-of-my-lifetime/index.html">defied my expectations</a>. I would like for him to be re-elected. I am hungry for him to be re-elected.</p>
    <p>I am very angry with Joe Biden as a foreign-policy president. Biden's foreign policy has made it difficult for me to support his re-election in the public, full-throated way that I would like to. Yes, when the alternative is Trump, Biden remains easily the better choice, even on foreign policy, on moral as well as practical grounds. But I am not at all happy with the Biden administration on foreign policy. I am chastened by my own moral vanity when I speak too highly of the person who has presided over the United States' policy with respect to Israel and Gaza.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, you should vote for Joe Biden. Vote for Joe Biden.</p>
    <p>I think a lot of people who share my electoral politics are making a terrible mistake. I will mock it as the "America Is Already Great" mistake, after Hillary Clinton's response to MAGA. A lot of center-left economics pundits are telling us this is a fantastic economy, and that's why people should vote for Joe Biden. America is already great.</p>
    <p>This is not a fantastic economy. I was going to hang this post on an article by Rogé Karma, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/us-economy-excellent/678630/"><em>The U.S. Economy Reaches Superstar Status</em></a>, which pretends to "ask how [the economy is] objectively performing". There was lots I could object to in the piece.</p>
    <p>But Karma gets it basically right in the end. (Of course!)</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Indeed, the out-of-control cost of housing is perhaps the biggest black mark on an otherwise excellent economy. This problem started decades ago—since the 1980s, the median U.S. home price has increased by more than 400 percent, twice as fast as incomes—and got even worse during the pandemic, as the rise of remote work prompted millions of people to seek more space. Those rising prices have collided with higher interest rates to produce the most punishing housing market in at least a generation. Would-be homeowners can’t afford to buy, and many existing homeowners feel stuck in place.</p>
     <p>Housing is one of several crucial categories, along with childcare, health care, and higher education, that have ballooned in cost in recent decades, putting a middle-class lifestyle further and further out of reach—what my colleague Annie Lowrey has called the “Great Affordability Crisis.” The past few years of high interest rates, which make borrowing money more expensive, have jacked up costs even more. And despite the recent good news, the U.S. still has lower life expectancy and much higher levels of inequality, poverty, and homelessness than other wealthy nations. For millions of people, getting by in America was a struggle before the pandemic and continues to be a struggle today.</p>
     <p>Still, that doesn’t change the fact that the U.S. economy has had a remarkable four-year run, judged against both its own history or the international competition. A few years of good news isn’t enough to make up for 40 years of rising inequality and stagnant wages. But it’s a whole lot better than the alternative.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Professional-class pundits are used to talking about the economy in cyclical terms. We're not in a recession! Unemployment is down! The stock market is up! GDP numbers are up! <em>This is a good economy</em>, by definition, right?</p>
    <p>No. What matters most is how the economy shapes lives and societies over time. Presidential performance is a secular, not cyclical, concern. We should not vote for a President based on whether, by some bit of luck or manipulation, unemployment numbers hit a new low or the S&amp;P a new high just before the election. Presidents should not emulate idiot CEOs, who eviscerated our economy by chasing numbers — hard data! — they imagined to be sufficient statistics for their performance. A President's job is to see through the cycles and shape a better future. In my view, Joe Biden has made an excellent start at that.</p>
    <p>But what is secular takes time to bear fruit. Joe Biden has just begun, <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">imperfectly but hopefully</a>, to reinvigorate America's industrial policy. The right way to promote this is the honest one: Big, important changes have been initiated in the structure of the American economy, but it will be too soon on November 5 to know how this experiment works out. The experiment includes dramatically strengthening labor unions, using subsidies and when necessary even tariffs to reshore critical industries, muscular antitrust enforcement that aims to undo concentrations of economic power and ensure vigorous competition. If the experiment is allowed to continue, it will also include higher taxes on the wealthy (as the Trump tax cuts will be allowed to expire for very high earners).</p>
    <p>The question before voters is whether this experiment should be allowed to continue, or whether it should be aborted.</p>
    <p>There's that story, undoubtedly apocryphal, where V. Lenin says, "After the revolution, there will be strawberries and cream for everyone." His interlocutor responds, <em>But Comrade Lenin, what if I don't like strawberries and cream?</em> Lenin replies, "After the revolution, you <em>will</em> like strawberries and cream."</p>
    <p>That's what all the rhetoric trying to "convince ordinary people" that this is really, <em>objectively</em>, a great economy feels like to me.</p>
    <p>The question of whether an economy is good is as "objective" as your preference for strawberries and cream. What matters for the economy, overall and longer term, is as well captured in the moment's economic statistics as GE's quality of management was captured in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE/chart/#eyJsYXlvdXQiOnsiaW50ZXJ2YWwiOiJtb250aCIsInBlcmlvZGljaXR5IjoxLCJ0aW1lVW5pdCI6bnVsbCwiY2FuZGxlV2lkdGgiOjEsImZsaXBwZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJ2b2x1bWVVbmRlcmxheSI6dHJ1ZSwiYWRqIjp0cnVlLCJjcm9zc2hhaXIiOnRydWUsImNoYXJ0VHlwZSI6ImxpbmUiLCJleHRlbmRlZCI6ZmFsc2UsIm1hcmtldFNlc3Npb25zIjp7fSwiYWdncmVnYXRpb25UeXBlIjoib2hsYyIsImNoYXJ0U2NhbGUiOiJsaW5lYXIiLCJwYW5lbHMiOnsiY2hhcnQiOnsicGVyY2VudCI6MC44LCJkaXNwbGF5IjoiR0UiLCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsImluZGV4IjowLCJ5QXhpcyI6eyJuYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6bnVsbH0sInlheGlzTEhTIjpbXSwieWF4aXNSSFMiOlsiY2hhcnQiLCLigIx2b2wgdW5kcuKAjCJdfSwi4oCMcnNp4oCMICgxNCkiOnsicGVyY2VudCI6MC4yLCJkaXNwbGF5Ijoi4oCMcnNp4oCMICgxNCkiLCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsImluZGV4IjoxLCJ5QXhpcyI6eyJuYW1lIjoi4oCMcnNp4oCMICgxNCkiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6bnVsbH0sInlheGlzTEhTIjpbXSwieWF4aXNSSFMiOlsi4oCMcnNp4oCMICgxNCkiXX19LCJzZXRTcGFuIjp7ImJhc2UiOiJhbGwiLCJtdWx0aXBsaWVyIjoxfSwib3V0bGllcnMiOmZhbHNlLCJhbmltYXRpb24iOnRydWUsImhlYWRzVXAiOnsic3RhdGljIjp0cnVlLCJkeW5hbWljIjpmYWxzZSwiZmxvYXRpbmciOmZhbHNlfSwibGluZVdpZHRoIjoyLCJmdWxsU2NyZWVuIjp0cnVlLCJzdHJpcGVkQmFja2dyb3VuZCI6dHJ1ZSwiY29sb3IiOiIjMDA4MWYyIiwiZXZlbnRzIjp0cnVlLCJzdHJpcGVkQmFja2dyb3VkIjp0cnVlLCJldmVudE1hcCI6eyJjb3Jwb3JhdGUiOnsiZGl2cyI6dHJ1ZSwic3BsaXRzIjp0cnVlfSwic2lnRGV2Ijp7fX0sInN5bWJvbHMiOlt7InN5bWJvbCI6IkdFIiwic3ltYm9sT2JqZWN0Ijp7InN5bWJvbCI6IkdFIiwicXVvdGVUeXBlIjoiRVFVSVRZIiwiZXhjaGFuZ2VUaW1lWm9uZSI6IkFtZXJpY2EvTmV3X1lvcmsiLCJwZXJpb2QxIjotMjUyMzIyMjAwLCJwZXJpb2QyIjoxNzE4MDY3NjAwfSwicGVyaW9kaWNpdHkiOjEsImludGVydmFsIjoibW9udGgiLCJ0aW1lVW5pdCI6bnVsbCwic2V0U3BhbiI6eyJiYXNlIjoiYWxsIiwibXVsdGlwbGllciI6MX19XSwiY3VzdG9tUmFuZ2UiOm51bGwsInN0dWRpZXMiOnsi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwiOnsidHlwZSI6InZvbCB1bmRyIiwiaW5wdXRzIjp7IlNlcmllcyI6InNlcmllcyIsImlkIjoi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwiLCJkaXNwbGF5Ijoi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwifSwib3V0cHV0cyI6eyJVcCBWb2x1bWUiOiIjMDBiMDYxIiwiRG93biBWb2x1bWUiOiIjZmYzMzNhIn0sInBhbmVsIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwYXJhbWV0ZXJzIjp7IndpZHRoRmFjdG9yIjowLjQ1LCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsInBhbmVsTmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0IiwiZWRpdE1vZGUiOnRydWV9LCJkaXNhYmxlZCI6ZmFsc2V9LCLigIxyc2nigIwgKDE0KSI6eyJ0eXBlIjoicnNpIiwiaW5wdXRzIjp7IlBlcmlvZCI6MTQsIkZpZWxkIjoiZmllbGQiLCJpZCI6IuKAjHJzaeKAjCAoMTQpIiwiZGlzcGxheSI6IuKAjHJzaeKAjCAoMTQpIn0sIm91dHB1dHMiOnsiUlNJIjoiYXV0byJ9LCJwYW5lbCI6IuKAjHJzaeKAjCAoMTQpIiwicGFyYW1ldGVycyI6eyJzdHVkeU92ZXJab25lc0VuYWJsZWQiOnRydWUsInN0dWR5T3ZlckJvdWdodFZhbHVlIjo4MCwic3R1ZHlPdmVyQm91Z2h0Q29sb3IiOiJhdXRvIiwic3R1ZHlPdmVyU29sZFZhbHVlIjoyMCwic3R1ZHlPdmVyU29sZENvbG9yIjoiYXV0byIsImNoYXJ0TmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0IiwiZWRpdE1vZGUiOnRydWUsInBhbmVsTmFtZSI6IuKAjHJzaeKAjCAoMTQpIn0sImRpc2FibGVkIjpmYWxzZX19fSwiZXZlbnRzIjp7ImRpdnMiOnRydWUsInNwbGl0cyI6dHJ1ZSwidHJhZGluZ0hvcml6b24iOiJub25lIiwic2lnRGV2RXZlbnRzIjpbXX0sInByZWZlcmVuY2VzIjp7fX0-">its August 2000 stock price</a>.</p>
    <p>There's no such thing as "objectively good". We don't all share the same values. We have radically diverse views about what a better future would look like. I want a prosperous future for us and so does Peter Thiel, but the shape of the worlds we aspire towards, what would count as prosperity, diverge. Some ways that the economy might "grow" bring the world towards Thiel's vision, others towards my own. Any delta between the GDP numbers of those growings is not the thing that matters.</p>
    <p>Expansion is most of the business cycle. We spent the majority of the last forty years in a "growing economy". Most economists, most of the time, would have characterized it as a "good economy".</p>
    <p>What did all that good economy, in a cyclical sense, compose to as a secular matter? A world that is <a href="https://www.leftanchor.com/e/episode-170-unlocked-america-is-pottersville/">Pottersville, not Bedford Falls</a>. A world in which the "successes" who buy our media companies and endow our universities are con men and financial predators, rather than people who produce more and better and cheaper goods and services. A world in which it's hard not to juxtapose a booming stock market — yay! — with relentlessly expanding profit margins, companies "too big to care" (as Lina Khan memorably put it), private equity rolling up medical imaging and shutting down Red Lobster while <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/23/spineless/">blaming shrimp generosity</a> rather than <a href="https://aramzs.xyz/noteworthy/what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster/">sale-leaseback financial engineering</a>.</p>
    <p>The American economy is dystopian, secularly. I agree that the Biden post-COVID cycle has not been so bad, has been pretty good along a variety of dimensions, although <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/index.html">not as good</a> as boosters protest too hard to claim.</p>
    <p>It's a point of light in a bowl of shit. If the people who are speaking on Joe Biden's behalf keep missing that, don't be surprised if voters go with the other guy. As Ian Welsh <a href="https://www.ianwelsh.net/le-pen-is-delusional-but-macron-deserves-to-lose/">put it today</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>This is the Brexit/Trump/Javier problem. To whit, when things are bad for a long time and nothing seems to help, people reach [for] something extreme. They know the status quo isn’t working and that things keep getting worse no matter who they vote for among the mainstream, so they look for someone or something completely different. Trump is a billionaire, but he doesn’t parse the same as normal politicians.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Don't sabotage Joe Biden's chances by making him out to be a normal politician. He's the only politician since Lyndon Johnson to begin to seriously try something different. Biden may "parse the same as normal politicians", but on questions of economy and society, he has been much more ambitious, much more bold, much more different than Donald Trump. He may be a fragile, senile, old man who farts on stage, but he's done the policy equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger benching 500 pounds.</p>
    <p>Credit him with that. Stop damning him with faint praise about labor market leverage already beginning to fade, modest "real wage" growth against tiny baselines, stock market performance that mostly helps plutocrats and the professional class they employ, housing "wealth" that for all of us who do not own a home represents a crushing liability.</p>

   <p>We've all seen this wonderful <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon by <a href="https://twitter.com/WillMcPhail/status/815899174474567680">Will McPhail</a>:</p>
   <p><img src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/09/authority-minimization/new-yorker-pilot.jpg" width="100%"></p>
   <p>There are real tensions between democracy and technocracy. The cartoon shows an example where, in fact, technocracy should rule. The people should defer to the experts.</p>
   <p>But if you think of yourself as pro-democracy, I hope you <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7317.html">thought the question through</a> a bit more than "Ha ha, take that MAGA blowhards!"</p>
   <p>If you think of yourself as a small-d democrat, you should recognize that there are serious tensions between democracy and technocracy. Democracy is based on the notion that everyone should have a say in how affairs are governed, because no one other than each and every one of us for ourselves has authority in deciding what ends we should pursue. Technocracy justifies itself by pointing out, accurately, that the broad public is incapable of devising means that will actually achieve its desired ends. You need experts for that.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, distinctions between means and ends blur in practice. We all share many values, but we weigh them quite differently. Experts can, and too often do, quietly presuppose a prioritization of values — and therefore of ends — that would reinforce their own status and role, and then demand deference as they move on to prescribing means.</p>
   <p>During the financial crisis, once "financial stability" was the priority — rather than keeping people in their homes, or winding down and replacing pernicious institutions, or ensuring distributive justice — then of course we had to listen to bankers as to means. Who else understood the plumbing of the system we were stabilizing? Such a shock, then, that the means the best experts offered involved bailing out banks and their creditors while squeezing debtors with mortgages.</p>
   <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/opinion/covid-fauci-hearings-health.html">continuing COVID</a> fight between "listen to the science" Blue America and <i>Plandemic</i> Red America is really a proxy war over whether disease minimization should have been the overwhelming priority, or ends like personal liberty and supporting commerce should have weighed more heavily in the mix. The public health community predictably presumed that preventing disease should be the overwhelming priority. (Predictably, since that is both a reasonable choice, and the choice that would maximize its own status and scope for discretion. I certainly agreed. I still do!)</p>
   <p>The public health community didn't mean to enter partisan politics. But unlike bankers, who very much did mean to take control in their own interest, public health will see its status and perhaps its funding diminished going forward, because it is now perceived by much of the country not as a neutral arbiter of facts and evidence, but as a usurper of discretion that properly belongs to the democratic public. We will all, unfortunately, be even less prepared when the next public health crisis hits. (I hope <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/06/bird-flu-swine-flu-2009-which-is-worse/678620/">not soon</a>.)</p>
   <p>It is good that members of a democratic public jealously guard their right to have opinions and to have them heard on questions of ends. The public ought to be suspicious of technocratic claims that circumscribe their ability to assert agency over public affairs. Expert communities really do snow the public, all the time. (I don't know whether COVID was lab-leak or zoonotic, but I think the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/the-lab-leak-theory-inside-the-fight-to-uncover-covid-19s-origins">case is pretty strong</a> that expert communities put their thumb on the scale early on in favor of zoonotic, in part to protect parochial interests.) But if the public becomes so allergic that we never defer to expertise, well, then bridges will collapse and planes will crash and all of our medicines will be snake oil.</p>
   <p>Democracy places an ethical demand upon experts that they on the whole are failing to meet. That demand is radical humility. It is human — and career-advancing — to play up ones abilities and accomplishments. Many of us quietly believe that if we had more say in how things are run, things would be run much better. Humility just at the moment when you might make a difference is a hard ask. But key to an expert's job is to actively minimize the scope of their claim to authority. When communicating with the public or with political figures, they must strive to impose the narrowest set of constraints their expertise will allow, because their duty is to support, not to gainsay or foreclose, the democratic public's discretion.</p>
   <p>Legitimate authority derives not from expertise alone, but from expertise in <i>service</i> of the democratic public. If you intend to wield your expertise as an activist, if you learned about climate science to change the world, great. Present yourself as an informed advocate, make your case to the democratic public, educate, convince, try to help them understand things as you do.</p>
   <p>But if you demand deference, if you claim that by virtue of superior knowledge, failing to adopt your policy positions is failing to "follow the science", then you are mixing the roles of expert and advocate. The name for people who do that is "hack". The prevalence of hacks in this sense — on cable TV, in think tanks, on social media, even among <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2018/03/30/importance-being-scholar-activist-opinion">well-meaning scholars</a> — has replaced a lot of public trust in experts with earned hostility. How are you supposed to feel about people who are actively disenfrachising you?</p>
   <p>Expertise can be a resource to a democracy. It can be the weapon of a faction. But it cannot be both at the same time.</p>
   <p>You can be both a citizen with an opinion and an expert with knowledge that less knowledgeable people should defer to. But you must keep those roles distinct. As an expert, you must present the largest space possible of options that might under <i>anyone's</i> values be reasonable to pursue. You must report, to the best of your abilities, the consequences and uncertainties surrounding each option without fear or favor. Even when that means people whom you think are terrible might get their way.</p>
   <p>If you put your thumb on the scale, if you present as authoritative claims that are tailored to further your own contestable priorities — however virtuous your priorities may in fact be! — you are heightening the contradictions between democracy and expert authority. You are tacitly making the case that meaningful democracy is impractical, and therefore one form or another of authoritarianism is inevitable.</p>
   <p>No, <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon, the democratic public should not try to fly the plane. But the pilot, for his part, must fly it to the place the passengers contracted to go.</p>
   <p>If some kind of science fiction catastrophe were to occur, and the plane must divert to a final destination from which rebooking will not be an option, then taking a vote of the passengers would absolutely be the right thing to do. If, when the pilot presents the destinations they have fuel enough to reach, she leaves out places she would disprefer... Well, she might get away with it! Or she might not.</p>
   <p>Regardless, it would be a sin.</p>

    <p>Towards the end of a generally excellent piece on housing, Hamilton Nolan <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/housing-is-the-economy">writes</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>[I]f your response to that is “hey let’s just build public housing units for all 400,000 people,” that sure sounds nice, but brother I am here to tell you that there are only 177,000 total NYC public housing units right now, and that represents the sum total of all that have been produced in the city’s history, and they don’t even fund the ones that exist adequately right now. So practically speaking, saying “just build public housing” is the equivalent of saying “just give everyone magical castles.” It is a nice goal but it ain’t happening any time soon and in the meantime, everyone needs affordable housing. To reiterate: the only long term path to bringing housing prices down to an affordable level is by building enough housing supply to meet total demand. Build more. Much more.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I fully endorse that last bit. <em>The only long term path to bringing housing prices down to an affordable level is by building enough housing supply to meet total demand. Build more. Much more.</em></p>
    <p>Indeed.</p>
    <p>But I disendorse Nolan's attitude regarding public housing. State-led development is the only solution to our housing catastrophe. We will figure that out, sooner or later. We will be much better off if we can figure it out sooner.</p>
    <p>The problem with YIMBY-ness has never been that YIMBYs are wrong to focus on housing scarcity in places people want to live as perhaps the most destructive economic ill we face. They are right about that!</p>
    <p>Their error has always been a pollyanna-ish idea that <em>if only</em> we would lift legal constraints we can easily understand to be unjust — exclusionary zoning whose roots are in racial segregation! — private markets would just resolve this problem and we would all be okay.</p>
    <p>But NIMBY-ness, as Nolan perceptively describes earlier in the piece, is endogenous to prosperous density:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>In cities where many people want to live, but which fail to build enough new housing every year to keep up with demand, housing prices rapidly reach levels only affordable to the rich. The middle class leaves the expensive cities. They move to less expensive cities, where they constitute an influx of new residents, and they are resented by the existing residents of those cities, who see their own housing prices rise as a result of the influx. Instead of rapidly building a lot of new housing to account for the influx, residents typically channel their resentment into a determination to keep everything as it is, which means a continuing lack of adequate new housing construction, which only serves to drive up rents and home prices further. And the cycle continues, from one city to the next to the next. People leave San Francisco because it’s too expensive and they move to Denver and then they make Denver too expensive and then those people move to Boise and make Boise too expensive and then those people move to your small town. Uh oh! You will teach them a lesson, by organizing your neighbors to fight against the damn new luxury condo building they want to build downtown. Eventually your town will become too expensive as well.</p>
     <p>We need to build more housing. If your city is too expensive it is because there is not enough housing to meet the demand. Build more housing. Stop being selfish.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note that your town doesn't need to already have zoning laws historically rooted in racial segregation. It will invent them, or it will invent something else, because the people who bought homes they love in neighborhoods they love, upon whose character they have based their security and lifestyle, into whose financial value they have leveraged their net worth several times over, will not stand for leaving those assets to the vicissitudes of private home developers.</p>
    <p>And then there are basic facts of physics and geography. Infill of existing density is challenging and costly. Infrastructure must be retrofit. Even if eventually there will be room for so many more, current residents may need to be displaced (and in practice often never become part of that many more). Greenfields grow ever more distant from the drivers of demand. Together, these factors <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1540-6229.12490">render housing supply curves "convex"</a>. (ht <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/what-does-it-look-like-to-build-more-housing.html">Tyler Cowen</a>) In English, what that means is that price increases translate less and less to housing quantity increases as metropolitan areas grow, regardless of the regulatory regime.</p>
    <p>When you are trying to rely upon the market to solve your problem, and then your advice is "stop being selfish", perhaps you should <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/george-packer/end-of-an-era-2-greenspans-world-view-fails-him">encounter the wisdom of Alan Greenspan</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>I made a mistake in presuming that...self-interests...were best capable... I have found a flaw. I don’t know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Private markets are based on selfishness. This idea that developers will be motivated by avarice to do just what you want, but homeowners must suspend avariciousness with respect to the asset at the very core of their lives? Good luck with that.</p>
    <p>The YIMBY movement has succeeded, like Max Weber's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/70587-politics-is-a-strong-and-slow-boring-of-hard-boards">proverbial</a> strong and <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/yimbys-keep-winning">slow boring</a> of hard boards, in making some real progress in some particular places. I will concede that, between <a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-and-research/accessory-dwelling-units">liberalization of ADU construction</a> and the astonishing "<a href="https://smdp.com/2024/04/03/californias-most-controversial-housing-law-could-get-a-makeover/">builder's remedy</a>", California has gone farther than I ever imagined it would towards coercing localities to build even against strong opposition of local government's best enfranchised constituents. It isn't nothing. It's a quite extraordinary political achievement. And I don't doubt that it helps, at the margin, for a while.</p>
    <p>But the core problem we face is much bigger than land-use. It is geographic inequality. We have created a country in which too few patches of geography are associated with vastly better opportunities and amenities than all the other places. As with individual inequality, some of this is "natural". Some people are taller than other people, and will have better chances in the NBA. Some places are lovelier and more temperate than other places. However, the actual inequality we are struggling with is not due primarily to these differences, but to our social arrangements. There are plenty of lovely places in the United States that could host remarkable and desirable cities. That they don't is a social outcome, not the result of any natural law.</p>
    <p>So long as just a few places offer so much more amenity, liveliness, and economic opportunity than everywhere else, supply growth in those already built-out places will nowhere near match the tsunami of demand they face from people who would migrate there if they could. The deep flaw in YIMBY-ism is that problem they accurately highlight is orders of magnitude larger than what the solutions they identify, promote, and support can plausibly address. Yet the medicine they propose is divisive and painful to people in established, lived communities, and tend to serve the better-off in favor of the worse-off, as market-based solutions usually do. Regulatory caveats intended to counter gentrification, exhortations to upzone places that are affluent and coveted rather than communities poorer and already precarious are well and good. But they cannot overcome the basic physics of market action, <em>to each according to his purchasing power, from each according to his desperation</em>.</p>
    <p>Even if YIMBYs got all the legal reform they wanted, if all residential construction was by-right and developers had free reign, it's not at all clear housing abundance would result. We've already discussed the factors that overdetermine "convex supply curves", under any regulatory regime. Then there are economic factors beyond regulation. The YIMBY dream is that, if regulatory constraints were lifted, swarms of home developers would engage in ruinous competition to build, driving down the price of the goods they produce and sell. In our contemporary, highly consolidated, economy, how many industries work like this?</p>
    <p>Let's hear from <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/why-we-cant-build-our-way-out-of-this-hot-housing-market/">Logan Mohtashami of HousingWire</a>, whom I think it is fair to characterize as a perpetual bull on the US private sector:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Unless the government steps in to build when new home sales demand gets soft, we will not add homes to the builders’ demand algorithm. Builders have learned to tightly control inventory by retreating from construction when demand becomes slack. Building more homes is bad business during weaker times... We won’t see the construction boom that people want because the builders are here to make money; they’re not here to fix the low inventory issues of the existing home sales market, which is their main rival for demand.</p>
     <p>This is why I have stressed before if you want a construction boom, the federal government will need to step in with deficit financing.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In general, firms prefer to produce small quantities at high prices, rather than large quantities at low prices, if they can get away with it. For now, for the most part, they get away with it. If you want to be a YIMBY optimist, you have to hope not only for <em>ixnaying</em> exclusionary zoning and environmental reviews and all of that malarky. You will need Lina Khan's very devoted attention to your municipality, in a domain which by its nature is unusually prone to consolidation. Urban construction always requires locality-specific capabilities and connections, and the people who have those are susceptible to being bought out. (I know. Don't be selfish.)</p>
    <p>What YIMBYs get wrong is the actual nature of the scarcity they need to overcome. You cannot, will not, overcome the scarcity of San Francisco. What you can overcome is the scarcity of <em>San Franciscoes</em>. If you create more demand drivers, more places where it becomes desirable to live, where important <a href="https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1256&amp;context=reports">agglomeration effects</a> take hold, you reset the picture. All of a sudden, there are greenfields very near your demand driver, which you can develop at efficient density without colonizing established neighborhoods. Eventually, established neighborhoods in older desirable places will redevelop themselves, in ways their own selfish residents determine, as desirable alternatives elsewhere become competitive threats.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-forever-promises-new-solano-county-investments/"><em>California Forever</em></a> notwithstanding, the private sector is not going to throw around capital in sufficient quantity to invest in places where there's not already a good business case to build — that is, where there's not already an obvious, preexisting demand driver.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite paragraphs I ever wrote is <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6846.html">this one</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>It’s a cliché that the government builds “bridges to nowhere” that the private sector never would build. That’s true. And it’s a credit to the public sector. Bridges to nowhere are what turn nowheres into somewheres. We need many, many more bridges to nowhere.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Turning nowheres into somewheres is a role of the state. It is not an easy role, by any measure. Of course there have been, and will be, failures, boondoggles. You could have tens of billions of dollars worth of boondoggle annually and it wouldn't measure anywhere near the social cost of housing dysfunction in the contemporary United States. All successful enterprises involve failures along the way, and until we <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">develop public sector institutions more tolerant of that</a>, we'll continue to impoverish ourselves and fall behind in geopolitical competition.</p>
    <p>If you want to know how I propose we build, read <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8772.html"><em>Microcities</em></a>.</p>
    <p>But of course there are a wide variety of possible approaches, and people much, much smarter than I am thinking about this. Before you come at me with your pessimism, yes, Milton Keynes was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/03/struggle-for-the-soul-of-milton-keynes">tragically conceived</a> at the height of automotive exuberance and there are things we should regret about it. But it is a <a href="https://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/news/people/milton-keynes-chosen-for-sunday-times-best-place-to-live-guide-for-first-time-ever-4554727">broadly successful metropolis now</a>. Ordos, China's most famous "ghost city", is booming after the Chinese state <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Society/China-s-largest-ghost-city-booms-again-thanks-to-education-fever">intervened</a> with the "artificial" demand driver of placing competitive schools there.</p>
    <p>States can do these things.</p>
    <p>Neither Milton Keynes nor Ordos strike me as good models to emulate. But in their imperfection they remind us, cities can be made. Even when made not so well, they can thrive. Next time, we'll make them better.</p>
    <p>New cities can house people. And they will, sooner or later.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Saoirse Gowan and Ryan Cooper wrote <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/project/a-plan-to-solve-the-housing-crisis-through-social-housing/"><em>A Plan to Solve the Housing Crisis Through Social Housing</em></a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Sweden, which undertook perhaps the most aggressive public housing plan of any country relative to its size, provides one high-water mark. The Swedish government set a goal of building 1 million new units in the mid-1960s when the population was only 8 million (or about the same size as New York City). Despite a few setbacks and problems, this goal was achieved in less than a decade – indeed it was so successful that Sweden had an oversupply of affordable housing for decades afterward.</p>
     <p>We suggest that 10 million new municipal housing units would be a viable 10-year goal. That is well short of a scaled-up version of the Swedish program, but still quite aggressive. We do not anticipate a U.S. affordable housing oversupply being a significant risk in the medium term.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I know, right? Laugh. In America, we know social housing as public housing, as <em>the projects</em> and we know how that goes. We have not built 10M new units.</p>
    <p>The problem of housing scarcity has only grown worse. As Nolan reminds us, what was once a pathology of San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, has metastasized. Boise has become aspirational too. I'd argue that this is the main reason why younger people (some older ones too!) are pessimistic about the US economy. Housing in the places people want to live is impossibly expensive. The dream of a chill, secure middle-class life in a safe and lively place with good schools is out of reach.</p>
    <p>So far, the housing apocalypse has been a boiling-frog game of musical chairs. The housing situation has worsened in increments, and the losers each round have been the least well-off. That is precisely the sort of problem the American political system is built to ignore. We blame the losers, and segregate ourselves from them. (Until, of course, we find it is our turn to lose.)</p>
    <p>But climate shocks are already beginning to change this. Well enfranchised, safely middle-class Americans are going to find themselves uprooted from homes they purchased as the foundation of their security, some directly by catastrophe, most by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/climate/insurance-homes-climate-change-weather.html">burgeoning insurance costs</a>. We are already in a phase of socialized denial, which we have institutionalized into state-backed insurers of last resort. Very soon, we will see one of those insurers outmatched by nature. Bailouts will be arranged.</p>
    <p>From that moment on, the fiscal calculus will have turned. State-led housing development will no longer be a matter of handouts to losers, supported out of self-regarding pity by liberals, subject to criticism and derision by conservatives. State-led development will be the only means we have of rehousing millions of hard-working families over a limited period of time. Our ability to do it well — to construct new, safer, places where people will genuinely want to live — will go a long way to deciding whether our collective future is dark or bright.</p>
    <p>"Social housing" is not a pie-in-the-sky project. It's an inevitability. We already face a deep and terrible housing crisis. The time to get good at building new communities, to exercise state capacity we will desperately need, to experiment and endure failures we must learn from, is right now.</p>

    <p>I think people like Trump because they know he's a loser like they often are made to feel they are too. Donald Trump is obviously a loser. But he's a loser who wins anyway, who is rich and famous and drives all the asshole winners fucking mad.</p>
    <p>That's why the weird apocalyptic "I am your retribution" talk works. He is the dick you don’t really want to be, but that you would be if you set your resentments and anger free. His fight is, in that sense, your fight. Most of us are losers in a winner-take-all society.</p>
    <p>The fascist aesthetic worships indomitable strength and the power to smite, sure. But people do not worship what is already theirs. They worship what they yearn to have. Fascists emphasize masculinity and <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/28/masculine-virtues/index.html">masculine virtues</a>, but haven't you met these people? Do you listen to their podcasts? Are they self-assured and self-reliant? Disciplined? To borrow their own typology, would you characterize MAGA leaders — quietly in your own minds, not as a matter of public point scoring — as "alphas" or "cucks"? They are anti-gay, but when in power they project strength in the form of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=b061e2632347ae6b&amp;q=putin+topless&amp;uds=ADvngMh7w-lsc2TkqfGrpcdaN0tYhAhYeNGij-sC-yrarFF-M8eXA0VFrOFba5pHfkgoZaIz9SpKk6INNh3RcZGYRBZz1i02EUPNh4RiENv595Jx6z9PYXzxtn6yRbH0pfK3Kx7YptzJevLhFsHJ0aX_EgjeL6JP_X21wKMHXw0djp0LtjQNoQdQr9gpRj915pN1k7TYO2HJGFe-ViNSfNC4F0W69D8zoPTjtHMo6baa3pKjqV3dLqeT_V9TyDMjNL-g-ciNLjrrx8mXtqxQhGjEzd-Ee86YbBVk33ayUwLIXRzNkw7qi0TEiq77MYvz6IVYgNQrlqkN&amp;udm=2&amp;prmd=invsmbt&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiivNXBwcKGAxUsRjABHcRQCgkQtKgLegQIDRAB&amp;biw=1375&amp;bih=938&amp;dpr=2">cartoonish</a> <a href="https://x.com/oliver_drk/status/1677469465968103424">homoeroticism</a>.

    <p>Trump's teflon armor comes not from the inviolability of his carefully crafted image of strength, but from the fact that when you expose him, when you reveal he is in fact just as weak and helpless and persecuted as his supporters (and many of us who are not his supporters) often feel, he never concedes, never apologizes, never backs down, always lashes out. He does not submit to the humilations we submit to, when we endure a really empathetic conversation with HR about how our remark was not up to the standards we are trying to uphold at this company. He is as pathetic as we are. He is us. But he is not so constrained.</p>
    <p>We had the revenge of the nerds and they turned the world into a plutocratic surveillance nightmare. We are ruled by people who still think of themselves as the bullied smart kids and resent critics, despite the tsunamis of predatory cash they ride.</p>
    <p>Now we may have revenge of the losers. I’m sure that will work out well.</p>

    <p>My friend Chris Peel recently did <a href="https://github.com/chrisvwx/taxFoo.jl">a deep dive into US Federal income tax schedules</a>. He computed effective tax rates by inflation-adjusted income for years 1862 to 2024, taking into account the standard deduction. I thought it'd be fun to visualize his results, and it's proven to be an interesting exercise.</p>
    <p>First, here's the full history of effective US tax rates as a single surface.</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-surface-with-std-deduction-front-south-east.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-surface-with-std-deduction-front-south-east.png" alt="Surface graph of US effective tax rates, 1862-2024"></a></p>

    <p>Our data is rates for married households, filing jointly. The numbers are computed from ordinary income rates only, so they will be overstated for high-income households, who enjoy a great deal of tax-advantaged capital income. All dollar amounts are CPI-adjusted 2024 dollars.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>What stood out immediately to me in this graph is the constancy at the middle. Since the World War II peak, rates have collapsed at the high end and at the low end. At middle incomes? Not so much.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at the same information as cross-sections by income.</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1862-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1862-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1862-2024"></a></p>
    <p>Now let's zoom into the post-war period. We'll begin in 1945, when the US had its highest income tax rates, from which they have subsequently collapsed.</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1945-2024"></a></p>
    <p>I think it's helpful to divide this picture into four categories:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Ultra high income: income ($10M, $100M)</li>
     <li>High income: ($500K, $1M)</li>
     <li>Middle income: ($63K, $100K, $200K)</li>
     <li>Low income: $10K</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(As of 2022, the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S1903">median income for married couples</a> was about $109,000. Assuming, conservatively, it has remained constant in inflation-adjusted terms, that would be $115,000 dollars today. Real median income has grown over time, and we'll want to encompass a bit above the median, so we let the range from $63K to $200K 2024 dollars represent our "middle".)</p>
    <p>The first lesson here is that <em>income tax policy has been least important for the middle-income group</em>. There's just a lot less variation at $63K, $100K, and $200K levels than at levels above and below.</p>

     <p><em>Data restricted to the period 1945 - 2024. Rates and ranges are rounded to whole numbers. Apparent miscalculation of the range at 500K is a rounding artifact.</em></p>
    </div> A second lesson, which was entirely new to me until Chris pointed it out, is that for low-income people, the crucial tax reform happened in 1970, under Richard Nixon! 
    <p><a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/file/182549/download?token=IeifAYsd">From 1944-1969</a> the standard deduction was defined as 10% of income to a maximum of $1000. That meant that, then and now, the standard deduction did very little for high-income earners. But before 1970, it also did very little for low-income earners. In 1970, the standard deduction became defined as a fixed amount, which meant that people with very low incomes could deduct everything. A fixed-amount standard deduction renders the effective income tax very progressive at low incomes, but its influence fades as incomes rise.</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1962-1972.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1962-1972.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1962-1972"></a></p>
    <p>A third lesson is just how terrible JFK's tax cuts were, for those of us who believe that democracy and a decent society depend upon preventing plutocratic wealth accumulation. Between 1963 and 1965, effective tax rates paid by $100M earners dropped by 20 percentage point, while a middle-income earner making $100K (in 2024 dollars) saw relief of 4 to 5 percentage points.</p>
    <p>A fourth lesson is that the period 1965 to 1980 was a political economy catastrophe. There were no tax increases on ultra-high-income earners during the period, but ordinary high-income earners saw their tax burden steadily rise.</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1965-1980.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1965-1980.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1965-1980"></a></p>
    <p>Ordinary high-income earners represent a very important group of people. They are most successful professionals, influential in society and much more numerous than ultra-high-income earners. This is the group that actually peoples the commanding heights of the economy and the media. Raising taxes on this group while holding plutocratic earners harmless was a terrible own goal. It delivered very little of the main benefit of progressive taxation (preventing plutocratic wealth accumulation!) while it sewed the seeds for a tax revolt.</p>
    <p>The tax policy of this period was not calibrated to win the hearts and minds of middle-income earners. Lower-middle-income earners did enjoy some tax relief, but upper-middle-income earners endured increases, the middle-middle was basically flat. I suspect the dumb policy was motivated fiscal revenue accounting. Increasing rates on high-income earners delivers revenue, while ultra-high-income earners avoided their much higher taxes by not realizing personal income.</p>
    <p>But financing the government is not about revenue in accounting terms. It depends on the disinflationary impulse that taxation provokes. Taxing high earners is less disinflationary, serves to finance spending less effectively, than taxing people lower in the income scale. Because affluent people's marginal dollar of income is usually saved rather than spent, taxing it does not reduce spending. So the additional revenue was largely fruitless. The additional resentment, however, made fertile ground from which a terrible flower would soon blossom.</p>
    <p><a href="https://x.com/interfluidity/status/1092519956439130112">Billionaire politics</a> is about making human shields of the merely affluent.</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-1988.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-1988.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1980-1988"></a></p>
    <p>A fifth lesson is that Ronald Reagan's tax policy was horrendous, and is largely still with us today.</p>
    <p>Those high-income earners who had grown resentful of their tax burden, which had been steadily increasing since the mid-sixties? They finally got their, um, retribution. Ultra-high-income earners, who had suffered no increase at all, hitched a ride on this tax revolution by affluent professionals and won the biggest rate cuts of all.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile lower-middle-income earners saw their rates <em>rise</em> over the period. What the fuck was the matter with Kansas?</p>
    <p>George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton undid only about a quarter of the damage Reagan had done. Not to mention JFK.</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-2000.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-2000.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1980-2000"></a></p>
    <p>And that is the world in which we continue to live. Post Y2K, rates fluctuate, but rates on ultra-high-income earners have basically been flat.</p>
    <p>Middle income rates rarely move much. But grading on a curve, cosidering the narrow range over which middle income rates do fluctuate, the tax cuts under George W. Bush and Trump did yield middle income tax relief. This relief has stuck, as only high and ulta-high income rates reverted under Obama, and nothing much has changed over Biden.</p>
    <p>While I'm sure it's true, in dollar terms, that the overwhelming majority of the 2017 tax cuts go to very high earners, Trump, unlike Ronald Reagan, did actually deliver at least a little to people at middle incomes.</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-2000-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-2000-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 2000-2024"></a></p>
    <p>(Low income effective rates have been flat at zero throught the period. If you are wondering where the $10K line is, it may be hidden by the x-axis.)</p>
    <p>Pulling back, the overarching story is simple:</p>
    <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1945-2024"></a></p>
    <p>Since World War II, US Federal income tax rates have fallen at every level. At middle incomes, they've deflated only modestly. But under the Kennedy and Reagan administrations, rates on ultra-high-income earners were demolished, in acts of social vandalism that have yet to be undone.</p>
    <p>By throwing just a few small chicken bones to higher-income professionals and the middle class, mad occultists opened a portal to resurgent plutocracy. You can feel its dark wings thumping. We are <a href="https://x.com/">living</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">with</a> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/barre-seid-heartland-institute-hillsdale-college-gmu">the</a> <a href="https://secure.winred.com/trump-national-committee-jfc/lp-ads-guilty-verdict-google/">consequences</a>.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it's time we reseal the portal.</p>

    <p>David Austin Walsh <a href="https://x.com/Gurdur/status/1794781436471640276">expressed frustration</a> with how difficult he has found landing a tenure-track position as an academic historian. He implied being "white dude" was one source of disadvantage in his search.</p>
    <p>That is a sensitive claim. The requisite, almost <em>pro forma</em>, scandal ensued. Walsh offered <a href="https://x.com/DavidAstinWalsh/status/1795029033777787327">an apology</a>, emphasizing perceptively the real source of his problem. Good positions in academia have been made scarce, cannibalized by the temporary and contingent roles into which Walsh himself has been slotted. In a game of musical chairs, it is an analytical error to blame any advantage of other players (real, perceived, or misperceived) for the difficulty of finding a seat. The recriminations just amuse the people who take away the chairs.</p>
    <p>There is a kind of irony in scabs lamenting the decline of good union jobs, except that academics have flattered themselves to be something above and apart from mere labor. Academics are society's true meritocrats, each one a self-made hero. The neoliberalization of the academy was sealed when faculty reconceived themselves as market victors rather than a guild or, in the more modern term, a labor union. Assistant, associate, full, adjunct, post-doc, graduate instructor, these are just a lot of words to describe a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/08/30/how-two-tier-unions-turn-workers-against-each-other/">two-tier</a> <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-two-tier-union-contracts-became-labors-undoing/">labor</a> <a href="https://www.tdu.org/how_two_tier_contracts_hurt_workers_and_weaken_unions">contract</a>.</p>
    <p>("Scab" is too cruel a word to describe Walsh and all the other adjuncts and postdocs who are victims of a dissolution of worker power they collectively help to perpetuate but did not author. I don't know if anyone has invented an epithet for high-seniority workers who acquiesce to two-tier labor arrangements, but there ought to be a bitter one. It is a deeper form of betrayal, and typically made under less duress, than "scab".)</p>
    <p>Anyway, tempest met teapot. So of course Chris Rufo had to chime in. He <a href="https://x.com/DavidAstinWalsh/status/1795186440701120831">wrote to</a> Walsh:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>There is a redemption arc available to you: tell the truth about DEI and academic corruption. The answer is not to grovel harder — self-abasement is repellent to all factions — but to take a courageous stand against the institutions that have gone astray. Everyone knows that you would have easily earned a faculty position even ten years ago, but the powers that be are pushing through underqualified "race and gender scholars" in all of the humanities departments. Your professional path as the "white male ally" has reached the terminus. Why not tell the truth?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I find this so amusing. I feel I just have to share.</p>
    <p>Our dear friend Chris Rufo seems to believe as a "truth about DEI and academic corruption" that attempts to increase diversity in academia have led to a decline in standards and faculty quality.</p>
    <p>Chris Rufo should know! He is no mere onlooker. Rufo is the great protagonist of the reconstruction of <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/27/new-college/index.html">my</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/05/03/we-haunt/index.html">own</a> <em>alma mater</em>, <a href="https://www.ncf.edu/">New College of Florida</a>, which the gentleman is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/opinion/christopher-rufo-diversity-desantis-florida-university.html">restoring to its role</a> under "the classical liberal tradition...produc[ing] scholarship in pursuit of the true, the good and the beautiful."</p>
    <p>Chris Rufo would never try to tilt scales in hiring or recruitment in order to favor some crass ascriptive identity like race or gender.</p>
    <p>Oh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/opinion/columnists/gender-studies-ron-desantis-florida.html">wait</a>.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Rather than reviving some traditional model of academic excellence, then, it looks as though New College leaders are simply trying to replace a culture they find politically hostile with one meant to be more congenial. The end of gender studies and the special treatment given to incoming athletes are part of the same project, masculinizing a place that had been heavily feminist, artsy and queer. When I spoke to Rufo last weekend, he offered several explanations for New College’s new emphasis on sports, including the classical idea that a healthy body sustains a healthy mind. But an important part of the investment in athletics, he said, is that it is a way to make New College more male and, by extension, less left wing.</p>
     <p>In the past, about two-thirds of New College’s students were women. "This is a wildly out-of-balance student population, and it caused all sorts of cultural problems,” said Rufo. Having so many more women than men, he said, turned New College into “what many have called a social justice ghetto." The new leadership, he said, is “rebalancing the ratio of students” in the hopes of ultimately achieving gender parity.</p>
     <p>But gender parity is not necessarily compatible with a pure academic meritocracy, which Rufo claims to prize.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Earlier in the piece, Michelle Goldberg points out...</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Rufo speaks a lot about academic excellence and the virtues of a classical liberal education. But as Steven Walker of The Sarasota Herald-Tribune <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/education/2023/07/27/new-college-of-florida-pursues-student-athletes-at-academic-cost-richard-corcoran/70445567007/">reported</a> in a damning July story, the incoming class recruited by the new administration has lower average grades, SAT scores and ACT scores than last year’s class. "Much of the drop in average scores can be attributed to incoming student-athletes who, despite scoring worse on average, have earned a disproportionate number of the school’s $10,000-per-year merit-based scholarships," wrote Walker.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I think we all have to concede, Rufo has proven his point. Attempts to remake a college in crass demographic terms can indeed be "corrupt" in the sense of elevating those of "lesser merit" by someone's contestable criteria over people who would be "more deserving" under those measures. And, this kind of ideologically motivated social engineering can be deeply intertwined with <a href="https://www.wusf.org/education/2024-04-12/richard-corcoran-200k-bonus-new-college-of-florida">astonishing</a> <a href="https://ncfcatalyst.com/the-changing-image-of-new-college/">patronage</a> and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/629209-david-rancourt-joins-new-college-as-dean-of-students/">careerism</a>.</p>
    <p>Rufo and his movement seem particularly wedded to rehabilitating masculine virtues, which I unironically applaud. There is indeed a crisis that demands redress surrounding masculinity. Whether we like it or not, males are and will continue to be nearly half of the population. They, like every other minority, deserve to be integrated in all of our institutions. We should acknowledge that the mere fact college-student populations are disproportionately female may not reflect invidious discrimination. Differences in outcome may reflect real differences in aptitude, interest, or ability. But we should treat skeptically claims that groups which underperform today must always underperform due to something inherent in their natures. Sometimes these outcomes reflect systemic, even <em>structural</em>, inhospitabilties entrenched in the institutions where members of the group seem to underperform. If a better developed athletics program helps to make differently gendered students feel more at home at New College, then I am all for it.</p>
    <p>Along with that, I'd encourage embracing the positive aspects of masculinity. Ideals like courage, chivary, and self-reliance.</p>
    <p>A man, for example, when he openly picks a fight, he lands his blows but he accepts that a few blows might also land upon him. At least perhaps glancingly, if at all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WUjgjN7Ssw">upon his shoe</a>).</p>
    <p>A man fights his own battles. He does not <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1677411849468547072">womanishly call in some overweening authority</a>, in order to absolutely crush a much, much weaker enemy half his age, in a fight he himself initiated.</p>
    <p>A man expects resistence in battle. He accepts it, respects it, even when it is his mission to defeat it.</p>
    <p><a href="https://x.com/socialistlegacy/status/1690062620508803073">Magnanimity</a> under circumstances where you have completely won, where the full power and authority of the state is yours to command, might <em>not</em> subsist in needlessly driving a helpless and defeated enemy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2023/08/10/charges-dropped-against-new-college-student-accused-spitting-trustee/">from their home and community</a>.</p>
    <p>I wish the project of restoring masculine virtues much greater success than it has thus far enjoyed.</p>

    <p>Kevin Williams has written a <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/">very good piece</a> about the straight-up superiority of Chinese electric vehicles. When Americans try to understand China's success at industry, they used to think in terms of cheap labor. By now we've come to acknowledge agglomeration effects. China has developed rich "ecosystems", which render proficiencies supportive of their industries effortlessly abundant.</p>
    <p>What Williams' piece highlights is product design. Chinese EVs are just better, cooler, more desirable products than anything Western manufacturers have on offer. That cuts deep. As industry after industry has migrated, many Americans continue to nurse a conceit, encapsulated in Apple's mantra "Designed in California. Assembled in China."</p>
    <p><em>Okay,</em> we like to tell ourselves, <em>our comparative advantage is no longer in fabricating things, with belching smokestacks and fussy labor. Our comparative advantage is the <u>high value</u> part, the <u>creativity</u>. It's fine and sensible that we outsource all the rest.</em></p>
    <p>Among many trenchant observations, Williams' piece notes</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Xiaomi...a phone manufacturer...decided to design and manufacture its own car. Unlike Apple, Xiaomi actually pulled this off, and the end product is so advanced it’s made headlines all over the world.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Apple just can't do what Chinese firms can. As Dan Wang <a href="https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/">has emphasized</a>, production excellence inheres mostly in tacit forms of knowledge that develop only via rich and continuous feedback across every aspect of product development. Apple in California is isolated from processes that should inform and inspire it. Even Einstein would not have been Einstein had there been no physics community into which he could enmesh himself.</p>
    <p>The word "ecosystem" has become something of a commonplace. But as Maria Farrell <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2022/12/08/your-platform-is-not-an-ecosystem/">has pointed out</a>, what the hypemasters of tech call "ecosystems" are better described as plantations. An ecosystem is a chaotic, polycephalic beast. It is a site simultaneously, paradoxically, of competition and collaboration. It is owned or controlled or dominated by no single organism or species. It is an always changing but also self-stabilizing web of interdependence.</p>
    <p>The idea of an "Apple ecosystem" is a contradiction in terms. Apple cannot be an ecosystem. Apple is flailing because it is starved of one.</p>
    <p>The United States is finally trying to reverse its great decline into forms of specialization and trade that lobotomize us. I am very supportive of, and very grateful for, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act">CHIPS Act</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act">Bipartisam Infrastructure Law</a>. But, I fear that rather than developing ecosystems, our political system is more likely to support a few plantations.</p>
    <p>Among the most destructive scandals in recent US history was the kerfuffle over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra">Solyndra</a>. Solyndra was a solar cell startup, to which the Obama Administration <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/solyndra-breaks-ground-new-500mw-solar-panel-plant">guaranteed $535M in loans</a> in 2009. When, unexpectedly, Chinese producers <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices">knocked the floor</a> from beneath solar cell prices, Solyndra's process became uneconomic. The firm went bankrupt in 2011, and the Federal government had to eat a loss.</p>
    <p>The larger program that had funded Solyndra <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/11/13/363572151/after-solyndra-loss-u-s-energy-loan-program-turning-a-profit">did fine</a>, even turned a profit for the Federal government. Without that program, there would likely be no <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/12/29/loan-program-that-funded-solyndra-finds-success-in-tesla-and-many-others/">Tesla</a>. Nevertheless, the embarassment and scandal surrounding Solyndra has discouraged politicians from lending to smaller, less certain ventures ever since.</p>
    <p>We in the United States are counterproductively attached to very simple and immediate forms of state accountability. Every meeting should be open and transparent. Every dollar spent should have a responsible party to blame if, sometime later, we decide that it was spent foolishly or corruptly. An opposing political party and an adversarial press eagerly collude to characterize even the most justifiable choices as corrupt, if in the end they don't work out. It's hard to get people to take a lot of risks under these conditions.</p>
    <p>Subsidy in China is helpfully more diffuse. In addition to overt subsidy (especially on the demand side), China finds ways to subsidize industries without accountable bureaucrats directly cutting checks. The central government simply communicates, widely and forcefully, that it wants effort devoted to an industry. Local governments and state-owned banks do the rest of the work. Local governments collaborate with entrepreneurs to put together ventures. Banks, which are not insulated from politics as Western dogma prescribes, become interested in funding such ventures.</p>
    <p>From <a href="https://ucigcc.org/blog/how-solar-developed-from-the-bottom-up-in-china/">an account of China's solar industry</a> by Jonas Nahm:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The inclusion of solar PV on the list of strategic emerging industries in 2010 and the goals set in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015) for the solar industry greenlighted subnational government plans to support their local solar firms. As a result, China’s solar firms had access to large sums of capital through bank loans, provided by state-owned banks and frequently guaranteed by local government entities or state-owned companies.</p>
     <p>Credit lines to expand manufacturing capacity were brokered and backed by local governments and state-owned firms, even in the years after the global financial crisis when the collapse particularly of European markets led to overcapacity in global solar markets. Providing loans was a way to improve local GDP growth rates, employment rates, and other indicators of economic development used to determine cadre performance and promotions. Solar PV’s status, first as a designated high-technology sector, and, starting in 2010, as a strategic emerging industry in central government plans further encouraged local government officials and state-owned banks to continue lending to China’s solar PV sector.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There does remain some market discipline. Entrepreneurs still put up their own capital. Banks still try to discriminate between better and worse ventures in targeted industries. The state subsidy takes the form of a coordinated bias in otherwise decentralized decision-making. China's historical success at growing industries through "big pushes" renders applications for finance in a favored domain genuinely superior to similar applications outside of one. A widely shared understanding that <em>this is what we are supposed to be doing</em> limits the downside risk to banks.</p>
    <p>Banks everywhere face soft budget constraints. Whether nonperforming loans must be written off, rendering a bank nakedly undercapitalized, or can be rolled forward is a regulatory choice, not a fact of nature. For banks, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2039.html">accounting is destiny</a>. By treating banks whose lending decisions generally align with state priorities gently, the state subsidizes those banks without ever cutting checks beyond routine lending of reserves to institutions that are deemed to be well capitalized.</p>
    <p>Because local governments more than the central government take the lead in finding or putting together ventures, there are no national Solyndras. Local failures are more forgivable than central failures, from a public perspective. <em>Of course</em> it's the work of local governments to try to make sure our region takes part in the next big industry. Favoritism of central governments is divisive. The public imagines there were many enterprises to choose from, and the best connected got the gravy. But in a local context, the public understands there often simply would not be an enterprise absent tax breaks and loan guarantees. As every American locality that has shoveled out money for a stadium can attest, arguments for development can overmuscle concerns about corruption.</p>
    <p>In this model, there is still eventual accountability. Among the politically well-aligned banks, those who stand out from the pack as bad performers might be made examples of. No matter how cheap the loans, entrepreneurs still stand to lose invested capital. Local governments struggle if tax breaks are never met with offsetting development. Where holes are deepest, officials risk defenestration.</p>
    <p>The "artificial" enthusiasm created by this kind of loose, untitrated subsidy encourages too many entrants, from an orthodox financial perspective. It engenders "overcapacity", vicious price competition, and more eventual failures than would be typical in an "undistorted" business domain.</p>
    <p>But when all is said and done, "inefficient" exuberance is a better problem to have than failing to develop the ecosystems that nuture high-value industries. In a firm-by-firm tally, a lot of money will seem to have been "wasted". But if a competitive, world-class industry emerges, its value to the nation will far outstrip the cost of all the defaulted loans.</p>
    <p><a href="https://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.htm">Ricardo's difficult idea</a> is at best badly incomplete. National prosperity does not derive from merely exploiting comparative advantage, but from ensuring the comparative advantage you exploit is in the highest value industries.</p>
    <p>From national-security perspective, high-value industries reflect globally scarce capabilities. On-shoring them relieves risky dependencies on potentially adversarial powers, and develops a point of likely dependence among trading partners which, if necessary, can be <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/44/1/42/12237/Weaponized-Interdependence-How-Global-Economic">weaponized</a>.</p>
    <p>The fiscal costs of China's indirect subsidies are shrouded, but they are very real. They are buried in arcana on the balance sheets of underperforming banks. They hide in flows from the central to local governments that ensure garbage still gets collected despite tax shortfalls. In drips and increments, most of the costs of failures end up on the central government's balance sheet. But there will have been no scandal, no Solyndra. And, if a globally competitive ecosystem has been seeded, the increment to public debt will be overwhelmed by the industry's contribution to GDP.</p>
    <p>It is unlikely that the United States could adopt China's approach to subsidy directly. In the United States we are obsessively allergic to anything that looks like state corruption, even while we lionize the architects and beneficiaries of every form of private corruption. This set of values does not work to our advantage.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, we can try to structure our subsidies to render them more diffuse. We could offer them through states and municipalities, rather than as direct Federal programs. We could offer cheap finance to <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/26/banks-should-fail-much-more-often/index.html">smaller, specialist banks</a> to fund ventures in targeted industries. We could precommit to tallying and evaluating loan guarantee programs in aggregate, telegraph early the expectation of failures, point to the venture capital industry as a model of failure-tolerant success.</p>
    <p>But unlike venture capital, we should expect and tolerate a moderate net loss across the whole portfolio. The goal is not to earn an investment profit, or to hide financial underperformance in positive-but-less-than-market returns we can pretend are still profit. The goal is to jumpstart decentralized, competitive ecosystems in high value, tradable sectors. Which is worth a fiscal cost.</p>

    <p>I think a lot of us have struggled to understand why. Why has Joe Biden been so indulgent with the government of Benjamin Netanyahu?</p>
    <p>Unswerving military support for Israel’s bloody war in Gaza divides Biden’s political coalition, and threatens his narrow electoral path. Of course, Israel is popular in the United States. Biden couldn’t just abandon the ally. If he were optimizing for domestic political support, however, he’d assure Israel’s defense, but also impose much more conditionality, exert much more leverage than he has so far, over both the ends and means of Israel’s campaign. Instead, Biden has chosen to provide full and fully unconditional military support to Israel. He expresses misgivings about Israel’s conduct as though his administration were an uninvolved third party, able to advise but not to constrain. Obviously that’s bizarre. The United States is an essential partner in Israel’s enterprise, not a powerless spectator.</p>
    <p>I have a conjecture to offer. What if Biden’s odd choices are not so much about Israel, but about US policy interests with respect to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, UAE? What if the domestic political costs of Biden’s position are the point, if Biden’s willingness to bear them is a costly signal to the Gulf autocracies that the United States’ commitment not to Israel but to <em>them</em> is “ironclad”?</p>
    <p>Beginning with the George W. Bush administration, but continuing through the Obama years, the United States went a bit mad. At the turn of the millennium and even after 9/11, the United States was the ultimate <em>status quo</em> power. It was, as a French foreign minister <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/news/to-paris-us-looks-like-a-hyperpower.html">put it</a>, the “hyperpower”.</p>
    <p>Ordinarily, a <em>status quo</em> power seeks to impose stability. When you are at the top of the heap, you want to keep the world very much as it is. Provoking revolutions against the <em>status quo</em> is usually the work of “revisionist" powers, who are unhappy with their own place in the pecking order and want to throw over the table to some greater or lesser degree.</p>
    <p>But hyperpower America was a bit drunk not just on its preeminence, but also on its ideals — freedom, democracy, human rights as we deigned to define them. We were the vanguard of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24027184">the end of history</a>, and we were going to hurry the rest of the world into looking much like us. We invaded Afghanistan and Iraq not simply to deter, or to protect our interests narrowly defined, but with a mission to transform those places into Western-style liberal democracies, which by their very natures would not export the kind of terrorism that had provoked us.</p>
    <p>And so, bizarrely, the preeminent power chose to roll the dice on everything, to overturn a very favorable geopolitical <em>status quo</em> and see what might come next.</p>
    <p>Even after its crusades failed, and a new President was elected — in large part because he’d demonstrated sound judgment by opposing the invasion of Iraq — the United States proved an unreliable anchor to the world order. Order, in a real world full of armies, is built upon agreements and alliances between existing, incumbent states. The United States was warmly allied with Hosni Mubarak’s Egypt. It had less warmly but quite actively partnered with Assad’s Syria during the “war on terror”. It had come to an agreement with Muammar Qaddafi, who dismantled Libya’s nuclear program in exchange for ending that country’s pariah status under what was still an American world order.</p>
    <p>And then came the Arab Spring. How could you not be inspired by what was happening in Tahrir Square? God knows I was. I think we all were. When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged caution — Mubarak was a friend, she said — we the people were outraged. Mubarak was a brutal, illiberal, corrupt, nepotistic tyrant. He did not uphold the rights that our ideals declare must be universal. Surely we couldn’t take his side against nonviolent protestors seeking to build a more just and free society?</p>
    <p>We didn’t. President Obama <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clinton-was-right-on-egypt/2016/01/28/fe7fe922-c609-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html">called for Mubarak to accede</a> to the protesters and step aside immediately. Ten days later, Mubarak had resigned. A disorderly “transition to democracy” quickly elected Islamist Mohamed Morsi (echoing the outcome in Gaza years before). Morsi lasted just over a year before some mix of revolution and military coup brought into power Egypt's current leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a figure very much like Mubarak.</p>
    <p>Egypt’s history is not the United States’ to make, but US action can constrain it. Would Mubarak have simply crushed the rebellion absent American constraint? We’ll never know. We do know that when Libya’s Qadaffi prepared to do just that in the country next door, NATO intervened to prevent the crushing. There too the revolution succeeded only to fail. Libya was left not with a Qadaffi clone, but a failed state, a continuing catastrophe by any measure. Qadaffi had made his peace, made a deal, with the West. He had surrendered his nation's nuclear program. But once Western passions about liberatory revolutions and human rights were inflamed, the Libyan government’s claim to sovereignty had to give way. Once again, the <em>status quo</em> power fanned the flames of unpredictable change.</p>
    <p>Putin is reputed to have described the West as “agreement incapable”. I have not been able to source the quote, but the sentiment seems clear in much of Putin’s rhetoric. Qadaffi’s experience underlines the problem. It’s not that the West is cynically duplicitous. (However much Putin likes to claim that too.) It’s that a very impassioned, immediate-term idealism can overwhelm politics in the West, making it impossible for countries like the US to keep commitments when they are needed most, in times of crisis when stability of a partner state requires credible threat of coercive violence. By undermining the credibility of any threat, an international politics of human rights may embolden rebels, and then threat must actually graduate to bloody crushing of the rebellion. Or else fail to do so, often with less-than-liberatory results.</p>
    <p>This risk is particularly acute for states whose order is kept by systems quite different from Western liberal democracy, and quite illegitimate from a Western liberal perspective. If Mohammed bin Salman, a leader most famous for his bone saw, faced a challenge like Qaddaffi faced, could any security commitment by the United States be credible? Americans might object that it should not be! We should not be complicit when a medieval homophobic tyranny crushes dissenters, along undoubtedly with their children and wives and endless other innocents. But should we be chastened at least a bit by the outcomes we’ve observed when we’ve restrained these states’ ability to maintain control?</p>
    <p>Regardless of what should or should not be, the United States is no longer a “hyperpower”. China alone is a near peer power. Geopolitics is again contestable, and becoming terrifyingly contested. The American policy community has belatedly realized it captains a <em>status quo</em> power and must preserve as best it can stability.</p>
    <p>Supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity is an easy lift for us morally, even if it is not militarily. Ukraine is at least aspirationally a Western-style democracy. Its borders were militarily overthrown by an autocratic external aggressor. We can launder our interest in stability through our Western ideals. We experience no ethical dissonance.</p>
    <p>But the Middle East is different. The allies upon whom we rely to superintend a fragile stability are not liberal democracies. Nevertheless, the US has been, and proposes to remain, their security guarantor. It would be a threat to our interests if they allied with our rivals. There may yet be another “spring” when these “tyrannies”, “autocracies” face the same kind of choices Qaddaffi faced in 2011. Can the US and the West be trusted to put alliances and security interests before the passions of their publics? When rebels are cast as Luke Skywalker and our allies as Darth Vader on all the social media, are we as polities even <em>capable</em>, not only of allowing the rebellion to be crushed, but even participating to some degree?</p>
    <p>If we are not, why shouldn’t these rulers prefer countries like China and Russia as security guarantors? China and Russia are demonstrably less precious about these things.</p>
    <p>When Joe Biden began his Presidency, he promised to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state. That was an easy promise. It appealed to Americans' lingering animosities over 9/11 and our aspirations to support human rights. But when Biden had to govern, he realized that the United States needs its problematic allies, and that they have alternatives. Biden’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/15/a-fist-bump-at-the-palace-biden-squares-off-with-mbs-00046106">infamous fistbump</a> was the beginning of a long concession of easy idealism to geopolitical reality. But it was only a beginning. No matter how sincere the Biden administration might be when it makes its deals and promises, when the blood hits the fan, would an American President even be capable of following through?</p>
    <p>And then October 7 happened. A US military ally faced an internal security challenge, and its government was inclined to bloody suppression rather than high-minded diplomacy. As images of dead children rolled in over the weeks and months that followed, US public opinion, particularly within the President’s own political coalition, soon came to favor some kind of ceasefire. Our ally disagreed, and wanted to continue its campaign. Would the outrage of the American public, or the risk of losing Michigan, force the administration to constrain rather than support its ally? If that outrage bleeds into civil unrest would the administration blink?</p>
    <p>My conjecture is that America’s Israel / Palestine policy since October 7 has, at least in part, been a long fistbump to America’s less democratic partners. Can the United States, under a Democratic administration, be trusted when its security commitments demand support of highly visible, politically difficult brutality?</p>
    <p>Yes we can.</p>

    <p>When they come to murder me, when they come to murder my child, we will not care in whose name it is done. We will not be martyrs. We will just be dead.</p>
    <p>Today no one murders my family, but in Gaza families await their murder.</p>
    <p>I will not chant <code>#FreePalestine</code>.</p>
    <p>The Palestinian national project is rancid. The Israeli national project is rancid. Each is Yin to the other's Yang. Israel's foundation as an aspirational ethnostate, Palestinian adoption of the same <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/10/13/national-self-determination-is-a-vicious-idea/index.html">national liberation self-determination bullshit</a>, first time in tragedy, second time as deadly farce. Imitation can be the most brutal form of flattery.</p>
    <p>I am for the British Mandate.</p>
    <p>Alas, I fear the inward-looking Brits will probably shirk the obligations centuries of empire might still impose.</p>
    <p>I am for the caliphate — Abbasid, not ISIS — which governed with sufficient liberality that even Jews could thrive.</p>
    <p>But we've waited a millennium for its return, and may wait a millennium more.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, for Israel and Palestine — two political communities, each sprung from the deadly stupid seed of national self-determination, each deformed ever more deeply by escalating rounds of murder and revenge, each correctly certain the other would annihilate it before granting what it takes to be its rights — the stupidest prescription is autonomy. "Freedom."</p>
    <p>Don't <code>#FreePalestine</code>.</p>
    <p><code>#ShackleIsrael</code>.</p>
    <p>What these two political communities require is restraint. Coercion. Subjection, until they reform themselves mutually into a political community that would enforce the rights of all residents of the territory they must share, and find ways to undo the damage they have done to themselves and one another and the world.</p>
    <p>While the caliphate is not and the Brits comfort their troubled king, the only empire on hand is a very compromised alliance of the United States and its autocratic Arab allies.</p>
    <p>We Americans like to comfort ourselves in world affairs that we are on the side of freedom and democracy, against some axis — it is always an axis — of autocrats and totalitarians.</p>
    <p>That's a dumb framing. We might squint and get away with it in Europe, but throughout the "global South" our allies have never been human-rights liberals. They certainly are not now.</p>
    <p>What we can be is for stability. And against murder.</p>
    <p>On the first, no accusation of hypocrisy can stick. We really don't want borders revised by force. We are done fomenting revolutions. In the Middle East, we might hope liberal democracy will emerge from autocratic stability, as it did in Taiwan and South Korea. But it's clear we prioritize the stability. Whatever else you might say about the Biden administration's handling of Israel-Palestine, it has worked assiduously to maintain alignment within its coalition, despite profound opposition among our allies' publics. The administration strives and has succeeded remarkably to contain the regionwide catastrophe a broad war against Iran and its proxies would bring. The United States is for stability.</p>
    <p>We have not stood so assiduously against murder, however. The character of Israel's actions in Gaza cannot escape that ugly word. However many roofs are knocked or pamphlets dropped, when it has become routine to <a href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/">blow up families when daddy's home</a> because daddy might have some junior-level connection to Hamas, you have gone past war to murder. Once you are, to put it generously, failing to protect aid workers in territories you control, when you know that absent assistance thousands will die of famine, you become guilty of their starvation.</p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, there were glimmers of hope that the United States would impose restraint. President Biden was to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-predicts-come-jesus-meeting-with-netanyahu-over-gaza-aid-2024-03-08/">provide</a> Bibi Netanyahu a "come-to-Jesus moment" over humanitarian concerns in Gaza. (Perhaps that was an unfortunate turn of phrase.) The US was going to construct a pier in Gaza for aid deliveries, the very presence of which might serve as a kind of tripwire. ("Mistakes" that kill aid workers who come straight out of US military facilities would be intolerable.) The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/michigans-strong-uncommitted-vote-shows-israel-impact-biden-support-2024-02-28/">campaign for "uncommitted"</a> in Democratic primaries brilliantly demonstrated the political risks Biden faced if he did not impose greater restraint upon Israel. When World Central Kitchen aid workers were <a href="https://wck.org/news/gaza-team-update">killed</a> in the sort of mistake that reflects such tremendous incaution it blurs with intention, Biden finally did have a "tough" <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-approves-reopening-erez-crossing-into-gaza-use-ashdod-port-aid-2024-04-05/">phone call</a> with Netanyahu, who quickly promised new pathways for aid to Northern Gaza. An invasion of Rafah, the last refuge for Gaza's civilian population, was to be a "red line".</p>
    <p>It wasn't much, but it was a start.</p>
    <p>Then Israel bombed an Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria, and Iran sent a barage of missiles and drones into Israel, and the plight of Gazans was forgotten. Political incentives which had been building to restrain Israel were overwhelmed by incentives to stand by Israel against a chronic common foe.</p>
    <p>Astonishingly — I think to the great credit of the Biden administration — the near conflict with Iran was deescalated. Pressure on behalf of the people of Gaza would, I thought, resume.</p>
    <p>It has not. On the contrary.</p>
    <p>In what would be a brilliant stroke of <a href="https://www.middle-east-info.org/take/wujshasbara.pdf">hasbara</a>, had Israel's brutal government not simply gotten lucky, American headlines became dominated by protests "in solidarity with Gaza" at US universities. As usual, press coverage of protests focuses on what is extreme, rather than what is representative. Then, <a href="https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/the-only-thing-university-administrators">incredibly dumb crackdowns</a> by careerist university administrators transformed the protests into battlegrounds of the United States' culture wars, rather than anything to do with people who might be bombed in Rafah or starved in Gaza City.</p>
    <p>For a variety of reasons — some fair, some not — the incentives these protests created for most politicians is to distance themselves from the protestors' cause. The people demonstrating in solidarity with Gaza have unwittingly rendered it toxic for US politicians to take risks on behalf of the people of Gaza.</p>
    <p>There are times when disruptive, oppositional forms of protest serve a cause. But there are times when the same acts undermine it. The protestors are in the right, with respect to the American controversy over free speech. Protestors have every right to express themselves, and universities should be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jacobtlevy.bsky.social/post/3kqlhkszozc2x">extraordinarily tolerant</a> of student expression, even when it notionally violates rules. Though there are undoubtedly extremists and idiots, claims that protests against Israel or for Palestinians are antisemitic or render campuses "unsafe" for Jews are mostly bullshit. Universities should err on the side of tolerating speech rather than psychological "safety".</p>
    <p>(<em>Tu quoques</em> on the political right are correct when they point out this ethos was often not respected on university campuses when psychological "safety" claims were asserted on behalf of groups other than Jews. They are right. That was wrong. They are still <em>quoques</em>.)</p>
    <p>The protestors have every right to protest in this way. But they should not. They are harming the cause they ostensibly support, if that cause is saving lives in Gaza. If the cause they support is a kind of accelerationism, under which Palestinian "martyrdom" is worth the price if it undermines Israel's legitimacy in favor of a Palestinian national project, then they should keep doing exactly what they are doing.</p>
    <p>I have a higher opinion of the protestors than that. I think they are protesting in order to end Israel's atrocities — in Gaza, and in the West Bank and in Jerusalem — not because they are devoted fellow travelers of a Palestinian national project. I think many protestors have not taken the time to think through the distinction. I beg them to do it now.</p>
    <p>The Biden administration faces no urgency to build that humanitarian pier, which was already supposed to have been built. It is under little pressure to threaten to withold weaponry, when Israel has already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-intensifies-strikes-gazas-rafah-ahead-threatened-invasion-2024-04-25/">begun to bomb</a> Rafah, perhaps in preparation for a misadventure.</p>
    <p>Six weeks ago, the administration was under a great deal of pressure. First Iran, and now student protests, have changed the equation.</p>
    <p>My dear protestors, what the administrations — of Columbia University, of the United States of America — want now is just to distance themselves from you.</p>
    <p>Often, as protestors, the goal is to get into the spotlight. If what you do is not spectacular, disruptive, then even if many thousands protest, media mostly ignore you. Politicians ignore you. So what is the point?</p>
    <p>But sometimes you need to get out of the spotlight.</p>
    <p>Sometimes your work is to do everything you can to put the spotlight where it belongs, on people who are starving, on the families who may soon be murdered if whatever happens in Rafah occurs with the same respect for civilian life that was shown in Khan Younis and Gaza City.</p>
    <p>While we are arguing over Columbia and NYU and NYPD, while we are talking about 1968 and another Democratic convention in Chicago, we are, to use the lingo, erasing the people whose lives are at risk. The people who might literally be erased.</p>

    <p>We argue a lot over how to manage social coordination. Market or state? Integrated within a large firm, or outsourced and bid?</p>
    <p>I think we pay too much attention to how we coordinate, and too little attention to the quality of what is coordinated.</p>
    <p>We do pay attention to quality at the most micro level. When the objects of coordination are individuals, we go on about "education" constantly. I don't think education is our problem. We are more and better educated than we ever have been.</p>
    <p>But the units that we actually coordinate, when we argue about state and market and the boundaries of firms, are not for the most part individuals. They are <a href="https://undsoc.org/2012/06/09/are-there-meso-level-social-causes/">meso-level</a> entities — firms or divisions of firms, government offices or non-profit organizations, churches or "social movements" (networked groups of people acting in common purpose).</p>
    <p>All of these institutions are eventually composed of individuals, of course. All rabbits are eventually composed of atoms. In theory perhaps you could deduce a rabbit's behavior from a complete understanding of its constitutive atoms. But in practice, to do anything meaningful with rabbits you will have to concede them their rabbithood, and make sense of them at that level. That they are almost entirely oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen will not get you very far. Similarly, you will not make useful sense of social affairs if you restrict your analysis to the characteristics of individual humans.</p>
    <p>Our firms and business units, our government offices and nonprofit organizations, our churches and social movements are performing poorly. I don't think the problem is so much that the market isn't working or the state isn't working, or that our mix of coordinating mechanisms is out of kilter. It's that the quality of what we are coordinating is bad.</p>
    <p>I hesistate to point this out, for fear I may encourage a new wave of grifters and management consultants to sell fixes. God save us. There is no "treatment" we can subject to random trials that will remedy this, one firm or organization at a time. The problem is systemic. Deployment of ideas so universal and straightforward they can be sold as "rational", "scientific", and "evidenced-based" is what did us in in the first place. We model firms as profit maximizing, so let's rejigger them to really become monomaniacal profit and shareholder-value machines, and mark all other aspirations contesting within these complex organisms as "agency costs" to be eliminated. Corruption is bad, and when we allow human discretion based on anything other than reviewable hard information — "evidence" — it becomes difficult to distinguish wisdom from corruption. So we ban wisdom, and demand every decision be justifiable on the most simplistic and legible grounds.</p>
    <p>We desperately require — and we do desperately require! — a society more just across racial, gender, and other identity fault lines. A bit oddly, identity categories are so universally recognized that identity demographics constitutes hard information. So whatever else an organization is up to, concerns about demographic balance crosscut and constrain whatever scope remains for internal discretion. To admit this isn't to say that racial discrimination is okay, any more than it is to say corruption is okay. It is to say that the approach we've taken to addressing these problems — having outside institutions police internal decisionmaking — imposes costs in organization quality. Perhaps there are <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8654.html">other approaches</a> that would be more effective with fewer downsides.</p>
    <p>As internal quality declines, organizations turn to <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/11/indirection-and-the-character-of-capitalism-part-ii/index.html">scale and market power</a> to ensure survival despite their deficiencies. Their dysfunction becomes everybody's problem more than their own.</p>
    <p>Our impulse when something is malfunctioning is to subject it to more intensive supervision and control. Often that is a mistake. It renders the thing we are correcting more constrained and more brittle than it otherwise might have been. If in fact the supposed malfunction was adaptive given the circumstances of the thing, and those circumstances remain unchanged, then imposing greater constraint will leave it seeking to malfunction in the same way, just able to do so less effectively. The thing is left crippled, rather than functional.</p>
    <p>A better solution is to change the circumstances under which the malfunction was adaptive. High tax rates on corporate <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7065.html">payouts</a> and <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8575.html">earnings</a> render firms <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9713.html">less obsessively profit maximizing</a>. Ecosystems made up of smaller organizations in competition with one another render corrupt decisionmaking less costly to outsiders (by narrowing the scope of its effect), and more costly to the organization itself (as corruption yields competitive disadvantage). <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7451.html">Rewarding integration</a> rather than policing and punishing discrimination relieves decision-making within organizations of constraint while incentivizing organizations to deliver a social good that we urgently require.</p>
    <p>I have views on grand questions like the balance between market and state. Those arguments turn stale and stereotyped very quickly. Across ideological fault lines, however, perhaps we might find a bit of consensus that we face problems not just in how we coordinate, but in the quality of what is coordinated.</p>

    <p>In what passes for the contemporary blogosphere, there's been a bit of a kerfuffle about tooth decay.</p>
    <p>Richard Hanania <a href="https://www.richardhanania.com/p/if-scott-alexander-told-me-to-jump">expresses</a> his admiration of, and his epistemological deference toward, <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/">Scott Alexander</a> by confessing he has "let some genetically engineered bacteria colonize [his] mouth" on <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/defying-cavity-lantern-bioworks-faq">Alexander's apparent say so</a>.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to do the same, Hanania offers an affiliate link you can use.</p>
    <p>The bacteria have been genetically engineered <em>not</em> to convert sugar to lactic acid, the corrosive agent that eats cavities into our teeth. These brave new microbes are designed to supplant our native population of tooth-decay germs, once and for all time, leaving nothing that can harm us.</p>
    <p>In a best-case scenario, this would be a near cure for tooth decay. Which would be a big fucking deal.</p>
    <p>But reality does not always dole out best-case scenarios. Only most of the time.</p>
    <p>Scott Alexander, whose vocation is careful, exhaustive reasoning, <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/updates-on-lumina-probiotic">pulls a "Woah, Nelly!"</a>. In response to Hanania's flirtations, he confesses that he thinks there's only a 50% chance these bacteria will help at all, and just a 5% chance the bacteria prove as powerful against tooth decay as the application of fluoride.</p>
    <p>Fluoridation, while genuinely a big fucking deal, did not cure tooth decay. I, like Hanania, had inferred a more optimistic take from Alexander's prior writing.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless Alexander seems enthusiastic about a project to bring these bacteria to market. A company called <a href="https://www.luminaprobiotic.com/">Lumina Probiotic</a> is just going to produce and sell the stuff. Apparently they <a href="https://www.luminaprobiotic.com/in-honduras">have</a> <a href="https://x.com/yishan/status/1777930637930024987">been</a> selling the treatment for some time in Próspera, Honduras, which Alexander <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/defying-cavity-lantern-bioworks-faq">describes</a> as</p>

    <p>Soon Lumina will sell it here too.</p>
    <p>You can <a href="https://www.luminaprobiotic.com/preorder">preorder</a> from their website, which patiently explains on <a href="https://www.luminaprobiotic.com/science">a page called "science"</a> how their microbe displaces native bacteria, reducing lactic acid which "erodes enamel over time, causing issues". Then, at the bottom of the page, "These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."</p>
    <p>Of course not.</p>
    <p>I'm not worried about all this. It's fine as far as it goes. With any novel bacteria, or any widespread deployment of anything once very niche, there are potential tail risks. Those risks seem ordinary, however, similar to lots of other things we do all the time.</p>
    <p>But is just jumping into the marketplace really a good way forward for a promising new treatment?</p>
    <p>Inventor <a href="https://dental.ufl.edu/profile/hillman-jeffrey">Jeffrey Hillman</a> and <a href="https://www.oragenics.com/">Oragenics</a>, a firm he cofounded, did begin putting these bacteria through a regimen of FDA trials. Alexander <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/defying-cavity-lantern-bioworks-faq">writes</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The FDA demanded a study of 100 subjects, all of whom had to be “age 18-30, with removable dentures, living alone and far from school zones”. Hillman wasn’t sure there even were 100 young people with dentures, but the FDA wouldn’t budge from requiring this impossible trial. Hillman gave up and switched to other projects (including <a href="https://www.oragenics.com/">an intranasal COVID vaccine</a>!)</p>
     <p>[Lumina founder] Aaron [Silverbook] heard this story and figured that brash, move-fast-and-break-things Silicon Valley biotech might be able to find an alternative route to commercialization. The strain was off-patent, so he first tried to synthesize it himself from the clues in Hillman’s published papers. When that didn’t work, he <a href="https://www.oragenics.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/163/oragenics-enters-into-agreement-with-lantern-bioworks-for">made a deal</a> with Oragenics for 10% of profits in exchange for samples and the full <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18ZDSe92LgLmS0sUbosvNxByii_1kjnEj">recipe</a>...</p>
     <p>The FDA has already set unreachable standards for any drug approval study, so Aaron wants to try a different route.</p>
     <p>The FDA has lower standards for probiotics than for drugs.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Kevin Drum <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/did-the-fda-kill-a-promising-new-way-of-preventing-cavities/">disputes</a> this characterization, and I think Alexander basically <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/updates-on-lumina-probiotic">concedes the point</a>. One, very small, human trial did occur — on denture wearers, because it was a safety trial, and dentures would be easier to clear than teeth if the treatment proved unsafe. That trial succeeded, and a second trial on real teeth was planned. (Via Drum, see articles in <a href="https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2008-01/germ-could-save-your-life/">Popular Science</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/health/bacteria-enlisted-for-new-trials-on-dental-health.html">New York Times</a>.)</p>
    <p>If it was FDA's fault the treatment didn't go forward, it was not because of "unreachable standards". The cost the agency exacted was time. FDA was cautious about transgenic therapy, for reasons that should be obvious after the last few years' "lab leak" debate. FDA made demands, which were understandable but far from trivial. Oragenics met them, but the process took a long time. Then Oragenics just stopped. Drum (remarkably) dug up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004751/http://www.oragenics.com/sites/default/files/wall_street_transcript_-_oragenics.pdf">transcript</a> in which Oragenics' CEO John Bonfiglio says "because of some regulatory concerns and patent issues, we decided to, at least for the time being, put it on the shelf and not develop it."</p>
    <p>Patent issues.</p>
    <p>The patent status of the bacteria is ambiguous. Drum <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/did-the-fda-kill-a-promising-new-way-of-preventing-cavities/">notes</a> that Oragenics scored a <a href="https://www.fdanews.com/articles/175418-uspto-grants-oragenics-patent-for-improved-replacement-therapy-for-dental-caries">patent</a> in 2016 for "Replacement Therapy for Dental Caries". In the press release announcing a collaboration between Oragenics and "Lantern Bioworks" (now apparently Lumina), Oragenics emphasizes, "Crucially, this agreement does not entail the transfer of intellectual property ownership from Oragenics to Lantern Bioworks."</p>
    <p>Yet a precursor of the Hillman's replacement therapy enjoyed its first <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/4133875">patent filing</a> <em>in 1978</em>. Alexander dates the current strain to a survey of grad-student mouth fauna by Hillman in 1985. Since 1978, Hillman has filed a <a href="https://patents.justia.com/inventor/jeffrey-d-hillman">steady stream of patents</a> many of which, at least to naive eyes, look like variations on the same theme. The most recent grant was filed in 2020 and approved in 2022. An application for <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20220347088">yet another</a> was filed that same year.</p>
    <p>US patent protection lasts no longer than 20 years, and is not renewable. Just because a patent is granted doesn't mean it can be enforced. Protection has definitely lapsed on the version of the bacteria upon which Hillman first sought to conduct human trials in 2004. Whatever the basis for Oragenics' 2016 patent, or Hillman's in 2022, a rival might successfully contest whether, in light of all the prior work, they are sufficiently <a href="https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/patents/patentability-requirements/">novel, useful, and nonobvious</a> to be enforceable.</p>
    <p>Indeed, while Oragenics crows about its "intellectual property ownership", Lumina investor Yishan Wong <a href="https://x.com/yishan/status/1780131552615420189">characterizes</a> the product as "in the public domain", flatly <a href="https://x.com/yishan/status/1777927499953189330">stating</a> that "[i]n 2023, the patent on the treatment held by Oragenics expired."</p>
    <p>So the issue seems not to be, as Alexander originally claimed, that "[t]he FDA...set unreachable standards". The issue is that clinical trials, while perfectly doable, are expensive. Since the treatment likely lacks enforceable patent protection, it's not worth it to any commercial entity to bear the cost.</p>
    <p>Under the circumstances, adopting a "move-fast-and-break-things Silicon Valley" ethos and characterizing the treatment as a supplement might indeed be an "alternative route to commercialization". But is it a good route?</p>
    <p>Alexander has <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/beyond-abolish-the-fda">previously examined</a> whether expanding the relatively <em>laissez-faire</em> regulation supplements enjoy would be a good circumvention of FDA bottlenecks. His conclusion is appropriately mixed:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>[Supplements are] shockingly safe — 50 - 70% of Americans take supplements regularly, and there are only a tiny handful of negative outcomes nationwide...</p>
     <p>On the other hand, there’s little agreement on which supplements work, or whether any of them work at all. Most doctors ignore the whole field rather than try to sort through the competing claims, and studies are few, dubious, and often contradictory...</p>
     <p>[A] company might release a great new drug as a supplement instead of seeking FDA approval, and then doctors might stay lazy and never think about it or prescribe it. In a perfect world, the company could use the revenue it makes from supplement sales to sponsor the FDA approval process. But in practice, if it switches from a supplement to a drug, that makes life worse for patients (they’ll need a prescription and lots of money for something they used to get cheaply and conveniently) and those patients would probably resist. So supplement status might end up as a ghetto that drugs stay in forever.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If our happy germs are indeed 95%+ effective against any reoccurrence of dental caries with basically no side effects, then releasing as a supplement might be great. Cavities develop slowly, so it'd take a bit of time. But early adopters like Hanania (and Mrs. Alexander!) would try the supplement. They would almost universally report never needing a filling again. Eventually we'd all catch on. That "eventually" might not be much longer than it would have taken to get formal clinical trial outcomes. In the meantime, early adopters would have been spared significant pain and disability, and an important liberty interest would have been served.</p>
    <p>But fluoridation would not have yielded such clear, word-of-mouth success. Alexander now claims that a fluoridation-level improvement is his 5% probable "best case", and that even if the treatment does work to some degree, he thinks its benefits are likely to be more modest.</p>
    <p>Absent clinical trials, how will we ever know the treatment works at all, then? How will we tell whether whatever we hear is genuine good news, rather than enthusiasm of TikTok influencers incentivized by Lumina or its less ethical future competitors? How will medical and dental authorities become comfortable to recommend the treatment?</p>
    <p>My own kid has suffered terribly from tooth decay, and addressing it has cost a small fortune. But as long as this treatment has the status of a supplement Joe Rogan might hawk, we'd be unlikely to risk it for him. Suppose the treatment actually does work. Does the welfare benefit of releasing it as a supplement exceed the welfare cost paid by people who might have benefited but won't because it will be insufficiently vetted?</p>
    <p>I think settling for this trade-off is just stupid.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of "move-fast-and-break-things Silicon Valley", and the adjacent rationalist community, is a prejudice against the possibility of a functional state. Alexander succumbed to this prejudice in his initial characterization of why clinical trials languished.</p>
    <p>Alexander comes by his views honestly, but "Silicon Valley" writ large does not. "Silicon Valley" telegraphs that the state does not work and cannot work, because the titans of Silicon Valley — the VCs and founders, sycophancy towards whom defines the culture — do not <em>want</em> the state to work.</p>
    <p>A working state has legitimacy, which means legitimacy to regulate, legitimacy to tax, legitimacy to enforce competition law and to break empires into pieces. No, no. The state is a dinosaur. Hayek proved it just can't work. Government is hopeless, broken. <em>It had fucking better be.</em></p>
    <p>Of course government <em>can</em> work. Despite very real pathologies, even today it works much better than we give it credit for. It has worked better still in the past, and, if we are not idiots, it will work much better in the future.</p>
    <p>If Dr. Hillman's microbe is effective, in order to realize its potential benefit to human health, we will need formal, clinical trials. Not to overcome regulatory speedbumps or to jump through bureaucratic hoops, but to persuade ourselves, at an institutional level, that it works.</p>
    <p>And not just any clinical trials. There are no two words more common and less credible in the supplements industry than "studies say". We'll need trials supervised and certified by some kind of authority — an administration even — to whose judgement various professional associations routinely defer, out of genuine respect for the rigor of its processes, or, more cynically, by virtue of a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3513.html">rational astrology</a>.</p>
    <p>But high quality clinical trials really are expensive! If the treatment is out-of-patent, who would possibly perform those trials?</p>
    <p>We have a state.</p>
    <p>A core function of our state is to pool resources and purchase public goods, like knowledge about the effectiveness of medical treatments. It is not a problem if an effective treatment is out-of-patent. It is a blessing. It means the treatment can be made available inexpensively. If it would have been worthwhile for the holder of a freshly minted patent to conduct trials, that means the social value of the treatment is much greater than the expenses FDA demands. We don't need to rip our hair out that there is no patent-holder to make this investment. We have a state.</p>
    <p>We even have a democratic state.</p>
    <p>Our democracy is deeply flawed. There is no more <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/28/urgency/index.html">urgent</a> task before us than to <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/28/how-to-understand-approval-voting/index.html">improve it</a>.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, our state remains more open and democratic than nearly any formal institution of comparable scale in human history.</p>
    <p>I have written to my representative in the US House and to both Florida senators, encouraging them to fund public trials of the genetically engineered bacteria Richard Hanania stuffed in his mouth on Scott Alexander's say-so. If it works, I'd like it to be stuffed in my kid's mouth as well, on the well-informed recommendation of his dentist.</p>
    <p>I encourage you, dear reader, to write your representatives in Congress too.</p>
    <p>Richard Hanania and Scott Alexander both have far larger readerships than this blog. If they believe that Dr. Hillman's treatment could be a benefit to humankind, they also could encourage their readers to write.</p>
    <p>If you believe in this treatment, you can feel edgy circumventing the regulatory state and making it available to biohackers. You can hit Hanania's affiliate link and become a biohacker yourself. Totally cyberpunk. Awesome.</p>
    <p>Alternatively you can help improve the institutions through which the treatment might contribute to the welfare of millions and ultimately billions of people. Maybe that's a bit cringe.</p>
    <p>Cynicism about democracy is a self-fulfilling prophesy. Only you can say what kind of prophesy you prefer to see fulfilled.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>p.s. <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/22/of-dentistry-and-democracy/Hillman-Dental-Letter-Luna-Redacted.pdf">Here's my letter</a> to Anna Paulina Luna, my representative in Congress. Feel free to use it as a starting point!</p>
    <p>p.p.s. If the treatment does work, the state should grant Dr. Hillman and Oragenics generous rewards, despite any weakness in their intellectual property portfolio. In general, we should deemphasize grants of monopoly to encourage innovation, and try other models, including <a href="https://protocol.ai/blog/transcription-vitalik-buterin-funding-the-commons/#what-is-retroactive-funding-and-what-are-the-benefits-12-33">retrospective funding</a>. State-granted monopolies may be time-limited, but they lack meaningful ceilings in the <a href="https://www.cepr.net/drugs-are-cheap-why-do-we-let-governments-make-them-expensive/">costs and economic distortions</a> they impose while they last. (And grantees have proven very capable of innovating around the time limits!)</p>

    <p>What really happened to Boeing?</p>
    <p>A cliché has emerged to explain Boeing's decline. Following the merger of the two firms, McDonnell Douglas' "financial", "Wall-Street-oriented", "bean-counter" culture displaced an engineering-centered culture that had hitherto prevailed at Boeing.</p>
    <p>I find this explanation unsatisfying, because I do not know what it means. "Culture" is a kind of catch-all in social affairs that can be deployed to explain almost everything everywhere, and so it usefully explains nothing at all. If the advice your theory yields is "change the culture", then you have no meaningful advice.</p>
    <p>Boeing's turning point was arguably when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Stonecipher">Harry Stonecipher</a>, formerly of McDonnell Douglas, more formerly of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Welch">Jack Welch</a>'s General Electric, ascended to the firm's leadership. Stonecipher's successor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McNerney">James McNerny</a>, also hailed from GE.</p>
    <p>Jack Welch managed GE as a certain kind of rationalist. The business of a business is to maximize revenue and minimize costs. Plant, labor, and raw materials are costs. GE was already a conglomerate, not a unified firm. Welch sought to rotate its holdings towards lines of business that would bring in greater revenue with fewer of those costs, which meant he increasingly favored finance over industry. He gutted activities like basic research, whose connection to revenue was too loose to reliably value. He imposed very blunt, clear, incentives — ranking all employees, firing supposed underperformers and giving bonuses to outperformers in fixed percentages.</p>
    <p>A thing to notice about this style of management is that you don't need to know anything about GE's particular businesses or technical processes to understand it. Welch's prescriptions reflected a form of economic rationality that is universally accessible, that could be taught in business school and tried anywhere. In my own little lingo, they reflect <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/02/11/situated-versus-unsituated-virtues/index.html">unsituated virtues</a>.</p>
    <p>But if you think the one weird trick to managing highly technical cutting-edge business processes at scale is a checklist of B-school bromides, you might just be mistaken. Basic research is very difficult to value. It remains essential to many firms' long-term viability regardless. Performance in highly collaborative processes may be hard to measure and easy to game. Canning supposed underperformers and rewarding "your best" might in practice lead you to shed your best and reward the cunning and disloyal. The mere exercise of ranking performance might undercut trust between employees, hobbling productive collaboration.</p>
    <p>So a simple, not wrong, story about what happened at Boeing is that Jack Welch acolytes were elevated to the firm's leadership, and began to impose Welch's caricature, one-size-fits-all, business-school-friendly management style on what had already been an excellent enterprise, and in doing so they destroyed it.</p>
    <p>I want to tell a slightly more sympathetic story. What, after all, was Harry Stonecipher supposed to do?</p>
    <p>A modern aircraft is a marvel of technology, built upon an edifice of hard, empirical, science. Every element of an aircraft can be precisely described, characterized, and tested. But each choice about how any of those elements should be designed and all of those elements should be combined introduces tradeoffs, benefits and costs that are not straightforwardly commensurable.</p>
    <p>You might think aeronautical engineering would be the ultimate "hard-information" kind of enterprise, but you would be wrong. The design space of an aircraft, the alternative combinations of plausible choices at every level from the tiniest part to the shape of the fuselage, is effectively infinite. There is no one true optimal design. Beneath the broadest specifications — how big, how far, how fast, burning how much fuel — an endless array of choices may have been made well or poorly, and expensively or cheaply. There is no objective measure by which to judge the quality of the process from outside of it. Designing and building — "engineering" — an aircraft is a soft information exercise. You can only have any idea if it is being done well if you are situated within the process and interacting with participants.</p>
    <p>The key fact to note about Harry Stonecipher is not that he was influenced by Jack Welch. It's that he was, for the first time <a href="https://www.historyoasis.com/post/boeing-ceo-history">in the firm's history</a>, an outside hire. Stonecipher had been President of McDonnell Douglas, which had under his stewardship been merged into Boeing. But he had no access to, no visibility into, no way to monitor, judge, understand, or discipline the <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that made Boeing work.</p>
    <p>In order to do his job, Stonecipher undertook to rationalize and simplify and render legible the firm. Lacking access to "soft information" that could only come from developing relationships within Boeing over years of collaboration, he sought to manage the firm on the basis of "objective" so-called hard information. Among the most salient hard information in any business enterprise is cash flows, so the sway of "bean counters" was elevated automatically. Among the least legible information in a firm, to an outsider, is the quality of employee judgment calls, so internal expertise was demoted.</p>
    <p>The Boeing Harry Stonecipher inherited was an integrated powerhouse. Every step, from the conception of new aircraft through their design, manufacture, and sale, was controlled and performed in-house. The new CEO infamously sought to transform the firm into a narrow specialist that would outsource all but a few aspects of the process. Again, you can blame Welch's simplistic B-school dogmatism for that. Specialization and trade are better than bureaucratic central planning. Focus on your core technology and let the market provide the rest. In retrospect, those ideas were obviously stupid for a domain where modification of any one element can cascade into requirements that myriad other elements change, requiring intensive coordination and costly renegotiation of contracts if those other elements are outsourced. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">Ronald Coase</a> is also taught in business schools.</p>
    <p>But the terms of contracts with outside vendors are objective and tangible in a way that continually evolving plans by managers and employees are not, especially when you don't know those managers and employees well enough to know whom to trust. Outsourcing was a business school fad by the early 2000s, but it also solved an information problem for Boeing's new CEO, who, fêted but flying blind, was trying to manage a company that ran on processes he could not evaluate or even perceive.</p>
    <p>Contracts, however, he could read. And understand, and negotiate. Organizational competences are soft information. The terms of legal documents are hard information.</p>
    <p>In <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300078152/seeing-like-a-state/"><em>Seeing Like A State</em></a>, James Scott famously described the perverse results that can occur when attempts to rationalize a system necessarily simplify it, eliminating as extraneous elements that in fact are essential, but whose role is not included in the reformer's simple model.</p>
    <p>How was Harry Stonecipher supposed to run a firm whose excellences were embedded in talents and habits that could not be tabulated, systematized or measured? Was he just supposed to trust the judgment of "old Boeing hands"? Which ones? With whom would the buck stop?</p>
    <p>That was his job. He <em>had</em> to reorganize the firm into something he could see, understand, and manage. So he did. Of course it did not help that Stonecipher and his successor James McNerny came out of Jack Welch's orbit. They had Welch's playbook too close at hand. But if you think the Boeing they inherited was a national treasure, the root of the rot was to bring in outside hires.</p>
    <p>Contrary I think to many of our perceptions, the vast majority of firms, especially larger firms <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/07/31/the-market-for-ceos/">promote their CEOs internally</a>. The idea of the superstar CEO turnaround artist, endowed with a managerial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)">g factor</a> enabling excellent leadership at any firm, is bullshit. Complex human institutions are their own realities, whose most important characteristics subsist in habits and relationships and invisibly distributed skills.</p>
    <p>Effective leaders certainly do strive to surface and measure objective, quantitative data about their institutions, and incorporate it into their decision making. But those kinds of measures cannot be remotely sufficient to guide and govern the living organism that we call a firm. Track your EKGs and blood oxygen and body mass and lung capacity all you want. You'll never think out how to get peristalsis right. A brain detached from, incapable of regulating, the most of what we are that is submerged and "autonomous" is the brain of a creature not long for this world.</p>
    <p>Firms like Boeing, that are not mere holding companies, but that develop and sustain and expand unique and complex competences, are each their own "deep state". Making outsiders brain and dictator of such an organism is an incredible disruption, an incredible sort of gamble. Perhaps when we have decided that the pathologies of our deep state so outweigh its capabilities, a YOLO on effectively killing the organism and reconstituting something else from its assets might make sense. But usually all you end up with is a corpse.</p>
    <p>Which is what Boeing is, or would be, if its customers and the government that regulates it didn't require it so much. It's a firm on a ventilator. Perhaps it can be restored to rude good health, but that will take a great deal of time and dedication and care, and I think recruiting a lot of help from people likely now retired who knew it, and made it, when.</p>
    <p>What it does not need is further bloodletting by shareholders. Even the most productive workers demand subsidy when they find themselves in intensive care.</p>

    <p>When <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/04/indirection-and-the-character-of-capitalism-part-i/index.html">last we met</a>, we saw that extending the basic capitalist circuit from M-C-M' to something much more indirect, like M-(M-(M-(M-C-M')-M')-M')-M', changes the character of capitalist activity. The controlling party in the more indirect case has little information about or ability to improve the core business process — the combination of commodity C and labor into a product salable for M'.</p>
    <p>Our indirect capitalist has basically one meaningful lever that she can exert down the chain of control, which we've called the squeeze. She can try to encourage greater efficiency by insisting that the layers beneath her remain "lean", with a minimum of surplus cash and a maximum of financial pressure.</p>
    <p>Her indiscriminate austerity can in some cases lead to real efficiency improvements. But she has no way to titrate the squeeze. She cannot even be aware of the subtleties of the core business process, and the relationships that support it. So it becomes likely that the austerity she imposes will lead to foolish economies, forcing the underlying business to prioritize short-term, "hard" cash flow over "soft" intangibles like relationships, reputation, maintenance and development of skills, standards of product quality. The net effect is to degrade the capabilities of the business, and over time, its economic value as well.</p>
    <p>This pathological outcome is often rewarded rather than punished by market forces, even over long periods of time, despite the clear impairment of the core business that it provokes.</p>
    <p>Let's understand how this works. We began with an economic unit, M-C-M, and we posited a buyer, so it became M-(M-C-M')-M'. But often a purchaser of enterprises doesn't purchase just one! A "holding company" may have multiple units. Suppose our buyer purchases three units. Then we have a structure that looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>            /(M-C-M')\
           M-(M-C-M')-M'
            \(M-C-M')/
</code></pre>
    <p>Of course, we can have more than one level of indirection:</p>
    <pre><code>            /(M-C-M')\
           M-(M-C-M')-M'
          / \(M-C-M')/ \
         /  /(M-C-M')\  \
        M--M-(M-C-M')-M'-M'
         \  \(M-C-M')/  /
          \ /(M-C-M')\ /
           M-(M-C-M')-M'
            \(M-C-M')/
</code></pre>
    <p>Maybe the first diagram is a regional supplier that holds three business units (each one its own geographically distinct shop with separate management). The second diagram is what happens when a national firm combines three such regional suppliers.</p>
    <p>We might further imagine a PE firm "rolling up" three such national firms, hoping to create an industry powerhouse. The level of indirection would increase by one, and the breadth would grow from 9 once-distinct commodity-transforming business units to 27.</p>
    <pre><code>             /(M-C-M')\
            M-(M-C-M')-M'
           / \(M-C-M')/ \
          /  /(M-C-M')\  \
         M--M-(M-C-M')-M'-M'
        / \  \(M-C-M')/  / \
       /   \ /(M-C-M')\ /   \
      /     M-(M-C-M')-M'    \
     /       \(M-C-M')/       \
    /        /(M-C-M')\        \
   /        M-(M-C-M')-M'       \
  /        / \(M-C-M')/ \        \
 /        /  /(M-C-M')\  \        \
M--------M--M-(M-C-M')-M'-M'-------M'
 \        \  \(M-C-M')/  /        /
  \        \ /(M-C-M')\ /        /
   \        M-(M-C-M')-M'       /
    \        \(M-C-M')/        /
     \       /(M-C-M')\       /  
      \     M-(M-C-M')-M'    /
       \   / \(M-C-M')/ \   /
        \ /  /(M-C-M')\  \ /
         M--M-(M-C-M')-M'-M'
          \  \(M-C-M')/  /
           \ /(M-C-M')\ /
            M-(M-C-M')-M'
             \(M-C-M')/

    <p>Obviously, in real life, actual bundlers or acquirers of businesses don't always purchase precisely three firms. We've chosen that number for convenience. Purchasers in real life aren't neatly stacked into levels. Very big firms can acquire tiny assets directly.</p>
    <p>But the broad point holds — each degree of indirection magnifies potential scale. One CEO who can handle three business-unit managers as direct reports can indirectly manage many, many units, if her direct reports can also handle three subsidiaries.</p>
    <p>It remains the case, as it was in our earlier discussion, that each with each level of enclosure, information is lost about the units that are subsume. It also remains true that the controlling interest has basically one lever by which to try to improve the technical efficiency of inner units, the squeeze.</p>
    <p>If the <em>internal</em> capabailities of businesses — how well they produce their product or provide their service — were what mattered most, these behemoths of agglomeration would be stumbling dinosaurs. They would fail in the marketplace. Indeed, during a more enlightened time (the 1970s), it became conventional wisdom that conglomeration was inherently stupid, for exactly the reason sketched here.</p>
    <p>But firms have <em>external</em> capabilities as well. Rather than improve business processes internally, they can alter <em>the environment</em> within which their business units compete, and find ways to help those units gain advantage even despite diminished capabilities and product quality. Instead of "focusing on their core technology", in the old business lingo, controlling interests of highly indirected units can exploit market power and political influence to enhance profitability.</p>
    <p><em>Indeed doing so becomes the core technology of the holding company.</em> As the degree of indirection grows, the holding company becomes ill-suited to compete on the basis of technical excellence with smaller firms whose management sits much closer to the technical process. They would be outcompeted in that niche.</p>
    <p>Further indirected firms are instead <em>specialists</em> in exploiting market and political power. As an economy tolerates greater degrees of indirection, one should expect technical quality to decrease while strategies based on exploiting market and political power come to dominate.</p>

    <p>via <a href="https://www.asciiart.eu/vehicles/airplanes">https://www.asciiart.eu/vehicles/airplanes</a></p>
    <p>There are, of course, a lot of caveats.</p>
    <p>Business processes may have technical <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8882.html">economies of scale and scope</a>. The argument above tacitly assumes that each business unit is already at the scale that exhausts technical economies of scale. If that's not the case, perhaps purchasing equipment and talent exploited too artisanally, and then bundling them into an enterprise that operates at scale, could yield efficiencies that more than compensate for any information problems or the social costs of market power.</p>
    <p>Of course nearly all business combinations tout supposed "synergies" by which greater technical economies of scale will be exploited. Both logic and experience suggest we should be wary of those claims.</p>
    <p>Logically, there is no need for a firm operating capably but at an inefficient scale to take on the information costs associated with less direct ownership. To improve efficiency, a more direct controlling interest can just raise external capital and grow to scale. This way, control remains at the level of the business unit, where managers understand the technical process, and are drenched in <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/26/banks-should-fail-much-more-often/index.html">soft information</a> about relationships with workers, vendors, and customers.</p>
    <p>If — but only if — firms are expected to thrive or die primarily based on technical prowess, then capable 19th-Century-style capitalists, hands dirty from the processes they manage, should be the ideal parties to raise external capital. Finance would mostly be a competition to find mid-scale business (most technical efficiencies are exhausted by moderate scale) whose principals are hip-deep in managing their firms.</p>
    <p>But if financiers see market power as the great determinant of success or failure in an industry, capital will flow to bundlers rather than do-ers, to important people rather than talented builders. Once some firms enjoy outsize market power, it becomes implausible for technical excellence alone to compete. A bad equilibrium takes hold. Capital providers expect winners to win, and become reluctant to finance smaller units, unless their exit strategy is to be acquired by a bigger fish. Investors understandably perceive a "kill zone" in going against "market leaders", and don't want to risk capital there.</p>
    <p>"Market leaders" then substitute predatory pricing for technical acumen, making quick work even of superior competitors who can't raise external capital to outlast the assault. And they can't. They would have raise a tremendous amount of capital, on incredible faith by investors, to last long enough that their less capable but better resourced competitors would even come under pressure to relent.</p>
    <p>Beyond the borders of <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">Hyde Park, South Chicago</a>, tactics like predatory pricing, payola, and construction of advantage by exerting political influence are effective. Capital providers understand this, so are disinclined to invest in quixotic new entrants. Then high cost of capital becomes yet another reason why smaller, more capable firms cannot compete.</p>
    <p>Any hope of a diverse "ecosystem" collapses. Only the consolidated survive.</p>
    <p>Ironically, given the hype bundlers deploy to justify acquisitions, even when there really are unexploited technical economies of scale across subunits, bundlers may lack the information and skill needed to recognize and exploit them. It doesn't matter. "Exploiting synergies" was always at best a secondary aspiration. Mere acquisition is enough to increase the bundler's market power. If there is "efficiency improvement" available, it is usually to shut down elements of the acquired business unit, eliminating competition while letting other units exploit the zombie brand.</p>
    <p>This may indeed be business-efficient! Revenue goes up! (We sell more brands, against less competition.) Costs go down! (Workers are laid off.) But no production efficiency is introduced. No business unit is transformed to operate at a more efficient scale. The only talent actually deployed is keeping a straight face while you gush to the world about the synergies.</p>
    <p>Actually exploitating economies of scale would involve neither retaining acquired business units, nor shutting them down, but combining them. It would require bringing the talents and assets of multiple business units together to hammer out a unified processes with thick information flows. This is hard, and risky. It requires deep knowledge of the various businesses, and still often fails. Indirect controlling interests know enough to know this. They don't usually try.</p>
    <p>Berle and Means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Corporation_and_Private_Property">famously</a> grappled with the separation of ownership and control inherent in modern corporations. In a public company, the controlling interest is really management and the Board of Directors, even though in principle the "owners" of the firm are shareholders. How do we prevent the managers of the firm, who are present and effectively control it, from putting their own interests before those of dispersed, distant, disorganized, passive, shareholders?</p>
    <p>Indirection turns that logic on its head. With indirection, owners remain distant, but they are organized, unified and active. Instead of protecting owners from managers, the struggle becomes to protect productive business units and the broad public from the predations of owners whose competitive strategy is to accumulate and exploit market power and political influence.</p>
    <p>And not necessarily owners.</p>
    <p>In order to explore "indirection', we've started by imagining small firms getting acquired and bundled into bigger agglomerations, yielding a kind of syndrome where</p>
    <ol>
     <li>The controlling interest of a large enterprise is informationally distant from the units in which core business processes occur</li>
     <li>The controlling interest imposes dictates on the units in which core business processes occur, even though it lacks detailed information about their operations and circumstances. Usually this is a "squeeze" to maximize the short-term cashflows remitted to the controlling interest.</li>
     <li>The dictates imposed by the controlling interest successfully achieve short term objectives, but impair the longer-term technical capability of the agglomeration.</li>
     <li>The agglomeration enjoys competitive advantage <em>despite</em> impairment of its internal capabilities, by shifting its focus from internal process to external action. It deploys market power and political influence to manage the environment in which it competes, rather than pursue production excellences.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is the syndrome, not the particular history, we are interested in. We claim this syndrome amounts to a niche or equilibrium that many industries find, and that the broader economy and financial system comes to accommodate or even demand, ensuring its reproduction.</p>
    <p>The controlling interest need not be owners. The term <a href="https://mostlysignssomeportents.tumblr.com/post/623632504091492352/target-workers-strike-over-chickenization">chickenization</a> is derived from the experience of chicken farmers who are notionally independent, but who work under contract to <a href="https://foodprint.org/reports/the-foodprint-of-chicken/">integrators</a>. Integrators both supply the chicks and feed, and pay for bulked-up birds. They dictate nearly every aspect of "independent farmers'" production process, yet squeeze them (setting them against one another in tournaments) to somehow fatten their birds ever faster. The integrators are the controlling interest, by virtue of the monopsony power they wield, even though they never formally acquire the farms that raise the chicks. I don't think anyone could argue that Tyson Foods, Pilgrim's Pride, or Perdue produce the healthiest or tastiest or in any sense best chickens. To the degree those leviathans seem to be "efficient" it is largly by virtue of shifting costs and burdens to workers, farmers, and consumers' long-term health in exchange for keeping prices at the register cheap. The chicken farmers they integrate have little scope in which to innovate. Product quality simply is not the basis on which these firms compete.</p>
    <p>Boeing is an interesting mix. It has grown informationally distant from the units where core business processes occur. However, this was not because it acquired but failed to integrate new firms, but simply due to a change in management in 2003. The new management had no visibility into Boeing's traditional, very excellent, technical processes. What they could not measure, they could not value, discipline, or control. So they undertook to reorganize the firm to be more legible and more "bottom-line focused".</p>
    <p>The reorganization succeeded, in the sense that the old technical processes were diminished, and replaced by contracts with outside vendors, which the new managers were capable of negotiating, understanding, and monitoring. Sometimes the outside vendors were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/22/business/worldbusiness/shares-of-aircraft-parts-maker-surge-on-first.html">spun out</a> of Boeing itself.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, this new regime is technically far inferior to the one that it replaced. Even competently outsourced work is more informationally distant than the well-integrated in-house process which Boeing had enjoyed when its leadership had been promoted from within its own ranks. And Boeing's outsourcing hasn't always been very competent. "Negotiating great pricing" <em>feels</em> like a competence to a manager. But when you negotiate from a firm you just spun out better pricing than the costs you would have borne if the work were still in-house, probably you haven't achieved some magical market efficiency. Probably you've just bullied a supplier into cutting corners, and hoping you won't notice.</p>
    <p>Boeing has a great deal of market power and political influence. The firm is essential to the United States in both commercial aviation and defense markets. Not many firms can get away with killing 346 people through incompetence and gross negligence in spectacular mediagenic accidents, yet face almost no meaningful sanction.</p>
    <p>The new, more outsourced Boeing is substantially a controlling interest of its smaller suppliers, over whom it wields tremendous monopsony power. Those great prices it negotiated, all those efficiencies that eventually turned into catastrophies, were just <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article1136058.html">the</a> <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/struggling-with-defects-boeing-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-fires-ceo/">squeeze</a>.</p>

    <p>Remember when the byproduct of capitalists making money <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm">was</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Capitalism now, at least in America, feels a lot more... flaccid.</p>
    <p>To be sure, money is being turned into more money more rapidly than ever before. But the gearing between that process and actual production of real-world goods and services seems weak.</p>
    <p>This is admittedly hard to measure. So many goods and services are digital now, and we can only really quantify them by "value", by how much people are willing to pay for them. If people are willing to pay half a trillion dollars to Google and Facebook (er, "Alphabet" and "Meta") for ads, should we hail that as our generation's equivalent of the application of chemistry to industry and agriculture?</p>
    <p>You can be as apologist was you wanna be. But I'll go with "no". In fields that require mastery over the forces of nature — rather than just mastery over one another's wallets — <a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-03-28-suicide-mission-boeing/">Boeing</a> really is the iconic American company.</p>
    <p>Here's a simple theory.</p>
    <p>Marx <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm">famously described</a> the general formula of capital as M-C-M'. That stands for <em>Money</em> ⇒ <em>Commodity</em> ⇒ <em>Mo' Money</em>.</p>
    <p>Ordinarily economists think of money as a mere intermediary in, or perhaps a veil over, the exchange of real goods and services (C-M-C), But for the capitalist, real goods and services are the mere intermediary, in a "circuit" that turns money into more money.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>the money itself is only one of the two forms of value. Unless it takes the form of some commodity, it does not become capital. There is here no antagonism, as in the case of hoarding, between the money and commodities. The capitalist knows that all commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell, are in faith and in truth money, inwardly circumcised Jews, and what is more, a wonderful means whereby out of money to make more money.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Setting aside the gratuitous antisemitism, in Marx's time the capitalist was typically <em>acquainted</em> with "commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell".</p>
    <p>The capitalist purchased the odiferous commodities himself. He managed, understood, and oversaw highly technical processes by which stinky raw materials were transformed into items suitable for sale to yield that sweet M'.</p>
    <p>Now let's think about what happens when capitalism evolves to a more indirect form. Consider the following circuit: M-(M-C-M')-M'</p>
    <p>Here we describe a new breed of capitalist, who treats the old capitalist's enterprise as itself a quasicommodity by which an initial investment M might be converted to a greater sum of money M'. In the course of this transaction, the initial capitalist is converted to a mere manager, or else retires and is replaced by a manager.</p>
    <p>The new purchaser does not herself take on the role of our first capitalist. Perhaps she tours the facilities occasionally, but in general she need never smell the stink of the commodities before they are reconverted to sell and smell like roses. She engages in a purely financial transaction. She pays M, receives control rights, and hopes by virtue of this process to earn a juicy M'.</p>
    <p>There are two things to notice. First, our new purchaser has little ability to contribute directly to the technical quality or efficiency of the production process. From her corner office in a distant skyscraper, she can only ever understand that process in the most abstract terms. Perhaps "on the business side" she can help a bit. Perhaps the accounting systems can be replaced with something more modern and shared across her other holdings, yielding a genuine efficiency.</p>
    <p>But to the core technical competence of the firm, she can contribute nothing, directly. Its work is simply outside of her domain.</p>
    <p>Perhaps she can contribute indirectly, however. Perhaps at the original firm, the original owner — 19th-Century capitalist bastard though he was — had personal relationships with his most skilled employees, his most loyal customers, the ecosystem of vendors from whom he purchased what to Marx becomes only C. Perhaps because of those relationships, the old man was paying more to his employees than their replacement cost in the labor market. Perhaps, recalling a time when his vendors kept him afloat through a cash-flow crisis, our capitalist did not always aggressively bid contracts for his inputs and go with any lowest cost provider. Perhaps work conditions for employees, many of whom he personally knew, were expensively pretty nice. Perhaps he kept prices stable for long-time customers even when the market would bear more, increasing production and delaying opportunities to win new customers in order to prevent stockouts. Perhaps he maintained a level of quality greater than was strictly necessary to make his sales.</p>
    <p>Our 19th Century capitalist was no altruist. He didn't do these things because he was a nice guy. He believed that by treating his employees, vendors, and most loyal customers well, he was being "long-term greedy".</p>
    <p>He might have been right, but he might have been wrong too. The optimal give in the give-and-take of positive-sum relationships is difficult to compute objectively. The milk of human kindness, especially towards people one knows and has known for a very long time, might become a source of cognitive bias.</p>
    <p>So, our purchaser in her corner skyscraper might actually contribute to the financial efficiency of the core business simply by a squeeze. If, by hypothesis, the enterprise was overpaying its workers, undercharging its customers, overpaying its vendors, and overspending on quality, then draining the enterprise of cash and keeping it under financial pressure might remedy that. Our new purchaser might even contribute to the <em>technical</em> efficiency of the core business process. What if the work environment had previously been so comfortable that workers had little incentive to innovate labor-saving improvements? Reduce the head count, and perhaps the remaining workers will develop ways of getting the same work done. That would be a real efficiency for the firm, and for the economy as a whole, as the workers who were laid off can be reemployed to produce new goods elsewhere.</p>
    <p>So, the M-(M-C-M')-M' process may genuinely yield efficiencies. But it remains the case that the controlling party is more removed from the technical details of production than the controlling party in a traditional M-C-M' operation. And beyond quickly exhausted one-offs like accounting synergies, she has only one lever by which to use her control to improve the business: Squeeze.</p>
    <p>Now consider the following circuit: M-(M-(M-(M-C-M')-M')-M')-M'</p>
    <p>Perhaps what initially was a small firm with its own factory is purchased by a regional supplier which is purchased by a national firm which is purchased by a private equity firm.</p>
    <p>With every level of indirection, the controlling interest grows informationally more distant from the technology of production. It remains capable of affecting the core production process via only the same single lever. Squeeze.</p>
    <p>In the one-level M-(M-C-M')-M' case, we hypothesized that perhaps the initial entrepreneur really was overpaying, undercharging, and underinnovating, out of cognitive biases derived from being too close to the nexus of relationships that constitute the firm. But the entrepreneur's "long-term greedy" theory was never wrong in principle. It <em>is</em> possible to underpay ones workers and vendors, overcharge ones customers, skimp on quality, in ways that improve short-term profits but impair the long-term value of the business.</p>
    <p>In the one-level case, the controlling interest may retain some capacity to judge and balance. The former owner, now the manager, of the enterprise can make his case for why it'd be foolish to sharply hike a big loyal customer's price to whatever the market will bear, for why accepting a bit of opportunity cost might be better for the firm over time. Shop-level management still has the ear of the controlling interest, who may be convinced that some indulgence of customers, vendors, and workers is in fact worthwhile. Sure, the buyer should squeeze. But she should squeeze only so hard.</p>
    <p>But once you get to M-(M-(M-(M-C-M')-M')-M')-M', that informational connection is entirely lost. If all you have is a hammer, every problem is a nail. If all you have is the squeeze, every problem must be inefficient slack. With each new level of indirection comes an increased bias to squeeze, and decreased information about intangible, forward-looking costs of the austerity you are imposing.</p>
    <p>Where our 19th Century entrepreneur may have suffered a bias towards overindulgence, our highly indirect owner suffers a bias towards "penny wise pound foolish".</p>
    <hr>
    <p>If this were the end of our story, capitalism red in tooth and claw might eventually sort things out for us. Enterprises too indirectly owned would make choices that, over time, would work out more poorly than "less efficient", less indirectly owned firms. The market might settle on some optimal degree of indirection.</p>
    <p>But another factor interferes.</p>
    <p>Indirection comes not only with depth, but with breadth and scale. Breadth and scale confer capabilities that, to the controlling interest, are real opportunities. But to society at large, they must be scored as costs.</p>
    <p>For more on that we must wait until <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/04/11/indirection-and-the-character-of-capitalism-part-ii/index.html">Part II</a>.</p>

    <p>The electoral system I favor for most elected positions is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">approval voting</a>.</p>
    <p>Under approval voting, voters are handed ballots identical to the ones they currently receive. The only difference is that instead of being asked to select our <em>one most favored candidate</em>, we are asked to select <em>one or more candidates</em> of whom we would "approve" for each position.</p>
    <p>Votes are tallied just like they are now. Every votes is counted, and the candidate with the most votes wins. Every candidate is allocated all of the votes they received, regardless of whether a voter selected one or several candidates. Approval voting is extremely simple.</p>
    <p>Approval voting addresses what voters most detest about the current system, that often we cannot express our true views without empowering those we most oppose.</p>
    <p>Suppose you are some neocon, neoliberal, never-Trump person. You don't like Joe Biden. He's been veering towards social democracy, which you call "communism". But Trump, Trump is an idiot moral catastrophe who will destroy America. Under the current system, your only choice is to hold your nose and vote for the communist. Even if your true heartthrob — Mitt Romney! — could be persuaded to run as a third-party candidate, you couldn't vote for him. It would split the anti-Trump coalition. Given the dominance of the two big parties in America, a vote for a third party means a vote withheld from one of the candidates that might actually win. So if you care about the consequences of your vote rather than mere narcissistic self-expression, you have to vote for the one of the two major parties you think least bad, rather than for the third-party candidate you love. But then the fact that you do this, and that everybody else does this, cements in place the dominance of two parties few of us are very happy with.</p>
    <p>Approval voting lets us break the cycle. Under approval voting, our beleaguered neolib neocon can put a check next to Mitt's name on her ballot, and also next to Comrade Joseph's. The first time around, while the two-party habit is still strong among us, the vote for Mitt is probably just self-expression. But it's no longer narcissistic self-expression, because now it does no harm. The vote for Biden still sets Trump back just as fully as it would have under our current system. And the self-expression is productively <em>public</em>. When votes are tallied, if a silent near-majority has expressed its love of Mitt and his new Old-Tyme Republican Party, voters will observe that, and next time around OTRP candidates will be real contenders rather than mere messaging.</p>
    <p>Under approval voting, voters can always vote their true preference without splitting their broader coalition and handing an advantage to the worst candidate. And because voters' actual preferences become publicly visible, the self-fulfilling dynamic that stabilizes our current two-party duopoly is undermined. Third-parties can emerge as contenders. Once major parties can submerge.</p>
    <p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">"Breaking the two-party doom loop"</a> is the first thing most discontents look for in electoral reform, and approval voting does that. But it does it in a way that has some really useful characteristics. In particular, <em>it privileges candidates who can reach across factional lines over candidates who appeal exclusively to their own factional base.</em></p>
    <p>In single-winner elections, where one person is going to have to serve a whole public, that person should be someone nearly everyone can live with, rather than a person adored by her own faction and hated by others. Elections ought not be contests over who will dominate whom. They are means by which we establish a government under which we all must thrive together.</p>
    <p>Not all elections should be single-winner elections! We absolutely do want the purest, strongest, and best expressions of all of our political factions to participate in government. We just don't want the purest, strongest, and best of <em>only one faction</em> dominating the government and usurping control of the state. At the Federal level, members of the US House of Representatives should be elected not by any single-winner voting scheme, but by one of the many electoral systems that yield proportional representation, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">MMP</a>, multi-winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single transferable vote</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_ballot">random ballot</a>. A deliberative body meant to represent and include the full diversity and cacophony of the polity is <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">quite different</a> from a single official who must serve the whole public. The two demand different kinds of elections.</p>
    <p>The US House should be assembled by proportional representation. The Senate, in which two at-large electeds must represent the whole publics of their states, should be selected by approval vote. That reform alone would dramatically alter the character of the body, and help render it a <a href="https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/senatorial-saucer/">cooling saucer</a> rather than a veto point for ideologues.</p>
    <p>Approval voting represents a very incremental reform. It is approximately the current system. The most obvious strategy for voters is simply to cast one vote for their most preferred candidate. Most people will likely do just that. If <em>everybody</em> did it, then nothing would have changed.</p>
    <p>But not everybody will vote only for their one favorite candidate. Some fraction of voters will "approve" two or more candidates.</p>
    <p>Contrary to some very mistaken presentations, people who select multiple candidates are not "casting multiple votes" and thereby usurping voting power, violating the principle of one-person-one-vote. On the contrary. Selecting multiple candidates under approval voting is an act of generosity. You have selected your first choice, but then you add a candidate that is someone else's first choice, that is lesser from your perspective, and put that candidate on an equal basis to your own. The more candidates you select, the less you are insisting "my way or the highway". You are supporting your way, but you are also assenting to other ways that are not yours, but you can live with. This inverse relationship between preference imposition and number selected becomes obvious when you consider what happens if a voter approves <em>every</em> candidate. That has the same effect on the outcome as simply not voting at all.</p>
    <p>So multiple selectors are generous voters. They are voters looking to find bridges and overlaps between their own preferences and those of other factions. And in what would be a close election if everybody chose only their fave — or under the current system — it is these generous voters, willing to make common cause with people whose values and interests differ somewhat from their own, who become kingmakers. Ironically, individually each voter cedes power by selecting more than one candidate. But as a class, approval voting elevates this group of less narrowly insistent voters to a position of influence.</p>
    <p>Approval voting disfavors "mobilize the base" electoral strategies in favor of outreach and persuasion. One shouldn't evaluate electoral systems only by the electoral outcomes they tend to produce, but also by how they shape the behavior of candidates and the electorate. Our current system, in which primaries favor factional extremists, who are then mostly either shoe-ins for their position or subject to coin-flip general elections, does more even than Elon Musk to turn politics into a carnival of performative whack. Approval voting would dramatically change candidate incentives, and by doing so, would dramatically change our society for the better, regardless of who wins the various contests. Approval voting promotes social cohesion.</p>
    <p>But wouldn't approval voting just elevate squish moderates, or even worse, "centrists"? I know, dear reader, you don't like "centrists". I detest "centrists". But what "centrism" has come to mean in American political discourse is the set of values and interests well served by the <em>status quo</em>, or at least the <em>status quo</em> as it prevailed until 2016. "Centrists" are socially liberal but fiscally conservative. "Centrists" don't want to tax billionaires, because they worry about incentives and "supply side effects" and whether soaking the rich would do "institutional violence" somehow to the country.</p>
    <p>The actual center of American opinion looks nothing at all like this. Across factional lines, taxing extraordinary wealth more heavily is close to universally popular. Only the very rich themselves, and the weird sliver of "centrists" that serves them, object. The actual center in the United States is less socially liberal on some causes than "centrists" (which is why "anti-woke" can be an effective populist strategy), but very liberal on reproductive rights, and is overwhelmingly live-and-let-live. Approval voting would give us politicians whose agendas would be better aligned with the actual center of the electorate. This would look nothing like the agenda of contemporary so-called "centrists" in politics and media.</p>
    <p>Approval voting would tend to yield candidates not perfectly aligned to my own socially liberal, social democratic views, but closer than what either party gives us now. And that would be the experience of most voters. From whatever direction we come, we do tend towards a common center when the politico-plutocratic freak show is not actively dividing us. Approval voting yields winners who deliver to no one everything they want. But its winners will be much closer to the vast majority than what's on offer from a duopoly that performatively chisels open social and cultural fissures in order to distract from a plutocratically constrained "consensus". And its winners will enjoy broader mandates than the <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7828.html">50% + one voter</a> that the current system tends to, making it easier for elected officials to actually get things done.</p>
    <p>Approval voting improves social cohesion. Social cohesion improves state capacity. State capacity deployed on behalf of a widely shared consensus improves all of our lives, in the ultimate virtuous circle.</p>

    <p>Here's a graph from <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31010/w31010.pdf">Autor, Dube, &amp; McGrew</a> on "The Unexpected Compression":</p><img src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/hourly-wages-by-quintile-autor-dube.png" width="100%">
    <p>I agree with many commentators on the (economic) left and center-left that <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/11/30/obama-was-the-most-destructive-political-figure-of-my-lifetime/index.html">economic policy under the Biden Administration has been extraordinarily — and unexpectedly! — good</a>. But that policy excellence has not, um, trickled down, to satisfaction and enthusiasm among its supposed working class beneficiaries.</p>
    <p>Among so-called centrist pundits, as I (uncharitably) tend to read them, I detect a hint of outrage. The Biden Administration has been working for the plebes like no other administration in decades, yet the ingrates don't give the administration any credit. There are shades of the old <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/08/14/fascism-as-triage/index.html">"economic anxiety" debate</a>. Really, it's pointless to try to do anything for downscale Americans. They are just a bunch of racists or (in the case of Black and Latino men) chauvinists and traditionalists.</p>
    <p>I want to emphasize, the Biden Administration <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/biden-economy-voters-polling-numbers-covid-recovery.html">really has been working to serve the working class</a> like no administration in decades!</p>
    <p>But so far, from the perspective of regular humans, the results have been underwhelming. The trends are meaningfully positive, and given four more years — or better yet an electoral trifecta ‐ I think the Democrats might enjoy electoral dividends. But November 2024 is probably too early.</p>
    <p>The graph above is the center of the case for working-class ingratitude. Since Biden took office, wage growth at the bottom of the distribution has dramatically outstripped growth at the middle and the top. If you check out the <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31010/w31010.pdf">paper</a>, you'll find similar graphs showing that non-college-graduates have done better than college graduates, young workers have done better than older workers, low-wage occupations have done better than mid- or high-wage occupations. Looking only at these wage stats, you might argue that Biden economy has served youth and Trump's base especially well.</p>
    <p>However, if you were to look at this <a href="https://x.com/Markzandi/status/1771943167962583131">triumphalist post by Mark Zandi</a>, you might conclude that the Biden Administration has been working for rich assetholders:</p>
    <p class="text-align: center;"><img src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/zandi-asset-growth.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
    <p>It's a rising tide lifting all boats, right?!</p>
    <p>Well, maybe. But in relative terms, or as an expression of priorities, the administration can't be working for working people <em>and</em> for the well-to-do asset-holding class.</p>
    <p>In dollar-weighted terms, the wage gains at the lower-end of the working class represent a small fraction of the $300K per household that their betters have effortlessly enjoyed. As Zandi points out, the less-affluent 40% earns nearly none of that, so those wage gains are swimming to keep up with $500K among asset-holding households. More realistically, the middle of the distribution experienced much more modest gains, while households at the top earned millions and billions. Working people continue to fall behind the asset-holding class under Joe Biden, even as the wage component of income has compressed.</p>
    <p>In general, wage inequality is declining at the same time as the labor share of income — when measured correctly for distributional purposes, including capital gains — has <a href="https://wealtheconomics.substack.com/p/total-income-and-the-collapse-of">declined precipitously</a>.</p>
    <p>But it's worse than that. Asset wealth, at least in theory, represents claims on future cash flows that are going to be paid by someone. The appreciating "nonfinancial assets" in Zandi's graph represents home ownership becoming ever more inconceivable to much of the public. Institutional investors now pay those flows, in order to transform them into exorbitant rents that working people will pay without accumulating home equity. Soaring equity prices, if equity prices are growing faster than unit growth in goods and services, represent expectations of increased profit margins that working people will find embedded either in prices or subdued wages.</p>
    <p>It's true that asset price collapses tend to be bad for "Main Street" (if the government fails to do its job) because the investor class panics and fires everybody and generally throws a temper tantrum to remind the world to be solicitous of <a href="https://mronline.org/2010/05/22/political-aspects-of-full-employment/">"business confidence"</a>.</p>
    <p>But that asset price collapses can hurt working people does not imply that asset price booms are good for them. A great moderation in asset prices — in the cost of housing, in the profitability of firms — is what best serves working class people.</p>
    <p>Never mistake applause from <i>The Economist</i> for quality economic management. The correlation coefficient is quite negative.</p>
    <p class="text-align: center;"><img src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/25/why-does-wage-compression-underwhelm/economist-pumped-up.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
    <p>Finally, it's worth thinking about the lingering hangover from the past few years' inflation. Among the commentariat, the explanation I often hear (with a suppressed condescending tone of "oh those idiots") is that even though <em>inflation</em> has declined substantially, the price level has not, so people are mad that their groceries still cost more than prices they anchored on a few years ago. (The condescension comes from sophisticates' understanding that, although the policy apparatus strives to bring inflation down to target, it does not seek, and would not tolerate, outright deflation to reverse an increase in the overall price level.)</p>
    <p>I can condescend with the best of 'em, and I don't disagree that this is part of the story. But I think economically sophisticated commentators miss something much more obvious, which is that constant nominal wages at a constant price level feel to an individual worker very different from getting a 4% raise that fully covers 4% inflation.</p>
    <p>Obviously, in the second case, there is an issue of lags. Inflation tends to mount continuously, while compensatory raises happen in discrete steps. Workers suffer losses in purchasing power for some time, even if raises eventually undo them.</p>
    <p>But more fundamentally, workers often experience raises as <em>rewards</em>, as the fruit of their personal merit. If a worker is given a big raise, she usually doesn't attribute it to macroeconomic circumstances, but to her own hard work and savvy.</p>
    <p>If a worker earns a constant nominal salary at a constant price level, she just never got a raise. But if a person gets a 4% raise and the price level rises by 4%, her experience is she <em>earned</em> a 4% raise through sweat and skill and staying late, ginning up the nerve to ask, demanding, holding firm. But then Joe Biden came along and took it away from her with his inflation.</p>
    <p>Our graph shows low wage workers enjoying a "real wage increase" of roughly 4% from when Joe Biden took office in January 2021 until July 2023, adjusting for CPI-U inflation. In nominal terms, that translates to our worker struggling and striving and wheedling from her asshole boss raises of 21% over the period, and then watching inflation eat away nearly 80% of the gain. No wonder she's maybe a bit bitter.</p>
    <p>If she had some stock, or a home whose value jumped from $400K to $600K over the period, she might feel a bit better.</p>
    <p>But people like that, you know. They just never plan.</p>

      <title>A simple theory of the stock market</title>

    <p>Why has the stock market been so ebullient?</p>
    <p>Even by very forgiving measures like price-to-earnings, which presupposes <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A466RD3Q052SBEA">extraordinary profit margins</a> will be permanent, stocks are <a href="https://twitter.com/jessefelder/status/1768625428292599882">overvalued</a>.</p>
    <p>The question is academic to me now. The recent rally has wiped me out, replacing my short position with a shirtless one. Still, why does valuation seem more definitively and durably than ever before simply not to matter?</p>
    <p>I present for your consideration <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1gpS4#">a graph</a>:</p><img src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/03/20/a-simple-theory-of-the-stock-market/balsht-equity-to-public-debt.png" style="width: 100%;">
    <p>The denominator here is "Federal Debt Held By The Public", which is a good measure of US government paper issued, whether as US Treasuries directly, or as Treasury debt transformed by the Fed into bank reserves or currency. ("The public" in this measure includes the Federal Reserve, but the Federal Reserve's holdings of government debt are transformed into currency and reserves in the hands of the non-government public.)</p>
    <p>The numerator is the market value of corporate equities, held directly or via mutual funds, held by US households.</p>
    <p>Since the 2008 financial crisis, this ratio has stayed approximately constant. Basically, the total value of corporate equities gravitates around 1.4 times the quantity of Federal paper held by the public.</p>
    <p>This is quite different from the prior era, during which this ratio fluctuated widely.</p>
    <p>My explanation for this is very simple. Prior to 2008, equity holders as a class were engaging in speculations — or investments if you prefer — based volatile expectations surrounding corporate cash flows. There were periods of optimism (the late 1990s tech boom, the "democratization of credit" era that preceded the 2008 crisis), and periods of relative pessimism about corporate fortunes, all of which had little to do with the Federal government's debt position.</p>
    <p>2008 began an era of asset-allocation dominance. Equity holders, as a class, are no longer engaged in speculations — or investments if you prefer — in cash flow outcomes. They had been taught, for <a href="https://isbn.nu/9780070580435">at least a decade</a> by 2008, that evaluating cash flows like a classic investor is a mug's game. Since stocks are riskier than other securities, some natural law of the universe would always ensure they eventually return more than anything else. Old-fashioned ideas like "valuation" could only mislead investors into foolish exercises like market timing. Just think of equities writ large as an asset that will always yield higher returns than other asset classes, at the cost that you must tolerate greater fluctuations in value. Then divide your wealth between this "risky" class and other assets — like cash and bonds — in order to titrate your risk and maintain a cushion in case you need liquidity during one of the bad fluctuations.</p>
    <p>Obviously, asset-holders are heterogeneous, and not everybody behaves this way. People still do speculate on individual companies, evaluate growth prospects and cash flows, all of that. <em>Relative</em> performance within the broad class of equities still reflects expectations of firm-level analysts.</p>
    <p>But in aggregate, the public simply seeks a portfolio with a ratio of $1.40 of diversified equity for every $1 it holds of goverment paper, treating the precise composition of the equity as a secondary question.</p>
    <p>The price of government paper is largely pinned. There is some play in longer-term bonds, where investor behavior can muck with the term premium a bit, but for the most part, the value of government paper is set by face value, duration, and expectations surrounding the Fed. The price of equities, on the other hand, fluctuates freely.</p>
    <p>So what happens is pretty simple. Suppose we start at "equilibrium", investors hold $1.40 of equity for every $1 of US paper. Suddenly, the government spends some money, or just pays interest on its existing debt.</p>
    <p>Now the aggregate investment community is out of equilibrium. Cash (which, for our purposes, is just Federal paper in any form) is now a "hot potato", in the traditional metaphor. People have too much government paper, which they try to exchange for equities, but that just creates a hot potato in someone else's hands, unless and until the phrenetic equity-seeking bids up the price of existing equity in proportion to the new injection of government paper. Investors want their $1.4 in equities for every $1 of US paper. To a first approximation, the only thing that can adjust is the price of equities. So it does.</p>
    <p>The behavior that drives this — valuation independent "investment" into "diversified equities" as a black-box asset class — enjoys a great deal of elite-intellectual and policy support. It is what good upstanding prosperous professionals are told they are <em>supposed</em> to do with their savings. Once upon a time, equity investing was understood to be a high information, potentially quite dangerous activity that a relatively small fraction of the public would engage in. Now, among prosperous professionals, <em>failing</em> to be long equities is a mark of laziness, stupidity, or some form of financial dissidence. Being invested in equities "blindly" — by which I mean without picking stocks or using valuation to time exposure — is what conventional, smart, politically enfranchised people do.</p>
    <p>Inevitably, a policy apparatus evolves to stabilize whatever conventional, smart, politically enfranchised people do. Post-crisis, the Obama administration openly gauged the quality of the plans it would have Tim Geithner announce by the reaction of the stock market in the days following. Trump crowed about his stock market and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/487588-trump-signs-chart-showing-stock-market-rally-after-he-declared/">autographed</a> ascending charts that he thought he could take credit for. There has long been perceived to be a "<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1196599083.shtml">Fed put</a>". Economists like <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/prosperity-for-all-9780190621438?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Roger Farmer</a> have made stabilizing an ascending equity price path ever more acceptable in policy circles.</p>
    <p>Valuation-independent investor behavior forms a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2015/03/cryptoasset-valuation.pdf">Nash equilibrium around equity price expectations</a>, in the same way and by the same dynamics as cryptocurrency booms. Unlike cryptocurrency, for equities the equilibrium is also stabilized by a wide variety of policy actors and instruments. Disproportonately enfranchised affluent professionals — call them the "top 30%" — are equity holders who have come to rely upon high equity returns regardless of the timing or valuation of their purchases. Equities fluctuate, sometimes wildly, but the most enfranchised citizens now expect an upward ratchet over a five to ten year horizon. Speculators' own self-fulfilling behavior joins forces with tacit but determined state support to deliver on that expectation.</p>
    <p>As a normative matter, we'd be better off if "equities" were just some arbitrary token or cryptocurrency. Perhaps the state could offer EquityCoin in fixed quantity, or with some precommitted, demand-independent, issuance path. Wise men and talking heads could encourage conventional professionals to divide their wealth between government paper and holdings of EquityCoin, rather than buying actual corporate equities.</p>
    <p>People like to imagine that by purchasing corporate equity, they are "investing" in the economy, allocating capital, making resources available to enhance future production of the goods and services that make us all prosperous. But bidding up the prices of existing corporate equities mostly does nothing like this. To a certain degree, okay. As share prices grow, firms are able to compensate employees cash-cheaply with options. They can borrow to finance new projects more easily. They can acquire conservatively valued private firms in exchange for just a few of their own overpriced shares. Firms do find circuitous means to take advantage of high stock prices, so, in very limited ways, mere share price appreciation can contribute to production.</p>
    <p>But as long as there remains some pretense — however tenuous or residual — that equity prices represent capitalizations of future cash flows, high share prices also impose costs and obligations on firms that may be socially counterproductive. To support share prices, firms repurchase their own expensive stock, which <em>drains</em> companies of cash, and <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/159.html">concentrates losses</a> on long-term shareholders should valuations ever revert. Even if equity prices in aggregate are continually growing, at individual firms, managers struggle desperately to maintain the ratchet, to ensure whatever today's share price is, tomorrow's should be higher. Or at the very least — God help us — no lower.</p>
    <p>I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5031.html">have</a> <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9713.html">argued</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/06/04/quietly-expensive-desperation/index.html">before</a> that we should think of "greed" as something structural, institutional, rather than an innate, individual characteristic. High share prices render firms insecure and rapacious as managers seek to ratify and support nosebleed prices with actual cash flows. When current profits comfortably justify their share price, managers might be content to grow by expanding quantity-produced at existing margins. But when the share price they must defend is not so justified, the pressure for profit growth may compel the same human managers to aggressively seek means of gaining market power and expanding margins at the expense of customers, vendors, and workers.</p>
    <p>High share valuations are both a cause and effect of our terribly unequal, greed-inducing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew-effect-ridden</a> social arrangements. They are an <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/07/10/cornering-the-future/index.html">ethical catastrophe</a>. We should not want them, but it is hard for people whose 401(k)s are long the S&amp;P 500 to want to see them to disappear.</p>
    <p>Equity-invested affluent professionals tend stereotypically to be "fiscally conservative". If the dynamic I conjecture above is correct, well, careful what you wish for.</p>
    <p>Share prices and government deficits are connected conventionally via the <a href="https://www.levyforecast.com/assets/Profits.pdf">Levy-Kalecki profit equation</a>. (ht <a href="https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/where-do-profits-come-from">Nathan Tankus</a>) But that effect produces no expansion of valuation: share prices grow because profits grow. The dynamic described here leaves deficits not only padding corporate profits, but also supercharging multiples, whenever government debt is growing faster than earnings. Deficit restraint would both impair corporate cash flows, and reduce cash injections that investors now rely upon to deliver share price increases via portfolio composition effects.</p>
    <p>One puzzle (to me at least) has been why high share valuations have been so resilient as we've transitioned from near-zero interest rates to short-term rates above 5%. I had, calamitously, expected share prices would not be so resilient. But if portfolio composition trumps valuation, then we should expect high interest rates to be good for share prices over the long run, despite short-term declines when raises are first announced. Interest rate cuts, by reducing fiscal injections, should be bad for stock prices over time, despite price spikes when markets first anticipate them.</p>
    <p>David Andolfatto has <a href="https://andolfatto.blogspot.com/2024/02/does-high-interest-policy-constitute.html">recently pointed out</a> that the short-run and long-run effects of interest rate changes can be quite distinct. Perhaps <em>ex ante</em> the stock market reacts through a zombie reflex discounted-cash-flow valuation channel, but <em>ex post</em>, once the cash actually flows — or does not! — the aggregate investor's thirst to conjure its desired asset allocation wins out.</p>

    <p>Since not long after Donald Trump was elected in 2016, there has been this <a href="https://www.democraticunderground.com/?com=view_post&amp;forum=1002&amp;pid=10905966">meme</a> <a href="https://www.benjaminlcorey.com/who-would-you-have-been-in-nazi-germany-the-same-person-you-are-now/">going</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeActRadio/posts/if-youve-ever-wondered-what-you-would-do-during-the-rise-of-nazi-germany-well-no/2854473587935899/">'round</a> among liberals, something to the effect of "If you've ever wondered what you would do during the rise of Nazi Germany, it is what you are doing right now."</p>
    <p>The implication, of course, is that Trumpism and the fascism lurking just beneath it places us in a position analogous to Germans in say 1933.</p>
    <p>I have no argument with the point. There is something to it.</p>
    <p>However, it is at best a kind of loose analogy. It's pattern matching deployed to persuade people of the moral stakes of our situation, and to identify which actors are right, and which are much worse than merely wrong.</p>
    <p>Germany (or German-occupied Poland) in <em>1943</em> rather than 1933 presents an even more morally evocative touchstone for comparisons.</p>
    <p><em>If you've ever wondered what you would do during the rise of Nazi Germany, it is what you are doing right now.</em></p>
    <p>In Gaza, trapped innocents are being killed in large numbers.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the comparison is unfair. The Nazis never tried to warn their victims with pamphlets and "roof knocking" to get out of harms way. Hamas provoked the current conflict with mass atrocity in ways the Jews of Germany never did. No country could be expected simply to tolerate an enclave ruled by terrorists who openly promise to repeat their atrocities again and again and again.</p>
    <p>All of that is true.</p>
    <p>Trumpists of course can also draw a lot of true and important distinctions between their movement and the actual literal Nazis of Germany 1933.</p>
    <p>The power of the analogy is to cut through the nuance and expose it as sophistry. This will always seem unfair when you are on the side whose defense requires nuance.</p>
    <p>Whether in God's eye the nuanced position is right or wrong, here on Earth moral intuitions are blunt instruments. Generally people will side with a penned-in defenseless population getting murdered, regardless of the bigger picture. As a heuristic, that doesn't seem so terrible.</p>
    <p><em>If you've ever wondered what you would do during the rise of Nazi Germany, it is what you are doing right now.</em></p>
    <p>People who make these kinds of remarks seem so certain they know who the Nazis are. But it could be us, too. The Nazis didn't think they were the Nazis, in the way we mean it now. Whenever we consider ourselves part of a group so inherently righteous we are immune, we become particularly susceptible to slipping into the role.</p>

    <p>Why is the world like it is right now?</p>
    <p>Why does it seem that we are putting more of ourselves than ever before into efforts to help, to make the world a better place, but we seem collectively to be growing only more incompetent?</p>
    <p>We are, as individuals, the largest, best educated cohort of human beings that have ever lived on Plant Earth. Sure, maybe Harvard teaches more woke stuff, or maybe we are manipulated by TikTok and Fox News or whatever. There have, nonetheless, never been more humans more capable and skilled at any other moment in human history. Todays' graduates of Harvard — and today's graduates of every State U — can read and write, perform mathematics, and make use of unprecedented technical tools more capably than any generation in history. If you are into IQ, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">Flynn Effect</a> means we are about as smart as we have ever been.</p>
    <p>Yet collectively, we are fucking idiots. If I may <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1407287">quote</a> Larry Summers, look around.</p>
    <p>I want to posit a very simple explanation for much of our aggregate incapacity. We now devote ourselves much more to <em>unsituated</em> rather than to <em>situated</em> virtues. But constructive action depends primarily on accomplishing situated activities, which the extremity of our dedication to unsituated virtues now undermines.</p>
    <p>What do I mean by "situated" and "unsituated" virtues? Unsituated virtues are virtues we can all recognize based on widely shared information and values. Situated virtues, on the other hand, are legible only within the context of specific institutions or circumstances. Only insiders, suffused in real-time institutional knowledge that would be difficult to formalize or communicate broadly, even perceive the choice set under which some actions would be virtuous and others destructive. Situated virtues encourage action that would further the mission of an institution in ways too indirect or internal or intuitive to easily communicate, let alone justify, to outsiders.</p>
    <p>Racial justice is an unsituated virtue. We all understand why racial justice would be a good thing and is a goal worth striving towards, or conversely how it is a shibboleth that woke elites abuse in order to subjugate working people and then legitimate that usurpation with tokenistic "diversity". You don't need to actually work in admissions at some specific university to understand or participate in this debate. The director of admissions at an elite college, the (now deposed) board of the San Francisco Unified School District that devoted pandemic year to an ill-starred renaming project, the HR director of any major corporation, all understand the project of racial justice on similar terms.</p>
    <p>Chris Rufo <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/new-college-florida-ron-desantis-takeover/673556/">famously understood nothing</a> about my <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/27/new-college/index.html">alma matter</a> before making it a battleground over "DEI". He didn't need to. His project is a "long march through" the institutions to counter what he perceives as the same long march through from the other side. His worldview leaves no room for the day-to-day, invisible-problems-solved, particular-goals-accomplished lifeblood of each institution. They are all just pieces on a vast chessboard, enacting a contest legible to all of us who let "politics" become our vocation and entertainment.</p>
    <p>"Woke" and "anti-woke" both are pursuits motivated by unsituated virtues. Obviously, to activists within each of these projects, the other is not motivated by any virtue at all, but by vice. Whoever is right, whoever is wrong, they share the same fundamental characteristic: They are driven by an "idealism" — or a "grift", whatever — that is not tightly tethered to the particularities of the institutions they seek to alter. Their project is overarching. It supercedes little details. They may eventually have to attend to idiosynchracies in order to bend those institutions to their will, but the direction of the bending is determined long prior to that attention.</p>
    <p>Another unsituated virtue is making money. Like woke and antiwoke, whether in some broad sense you consider making money virtuous or vicious is besides the point. It is a virtue in the sense that it is a thing many of us individually and collaboratively pursue. We behave as though making money, and making more money, would be a good thing. We certainly try to achieve it.</p>
    <p>The "shareholder value revolution" that took root in the 1970s was explicitly and proudly a project intended to subordinate situated virtues (which economists disparaged as "agency costs") to the unsituated virtue of profit maximization. The theory was that profit maximization promotes economic efficiency and social good, so whatever firms do that is not conspicuously profit maximization — any way they attend unnecessarily to internal, invisible projects and concerns — can only constitute waste. By incentivizing managers to focus solely on externally legible shareholder value — and ripping away cash flows that might otherwise "burn a hole in managers' pockets" — the revolutionaries sought to make the real world fit a simple economic model under which perfectly competitive profit maximization yields at least Pareto optimal outcomes, if not a true maximization of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5149.html">welfare</a>.</p>
    <p>This project was rich with an irony its protagonists mostly failed to notice. Politically they allied themselves with the Friedrich Hayeks of the world. But Hayek's enthusiasm for market mechanisms was <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html">based precisely on humility</a> about what disembodied wise outsiders could possibly know about a world in which welfare-relevant information is radically and illegibly dispersed.</p>
    <p>The shareholder value revolutionaries were not driven by humility. They were sure that an absurdly stylized model connecting immaculate profit-maximizing firms, share prices, and social welfare was all they needed to understand. They had no compunction about imposing the crudest incentives as strongly as possible for precisely the purpose of overwhelming any invisible, illegible, particular concerns that might interfere with the project of maximizing near-term — and therefore long-term, because our protagonists believed markets "efficient" — share prices. And so we emerged with leaner, more efficient, firms. Like <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/24052245/boeing-corporate-culture-737-airplane-safety-door-plug">Boeing</a>.</p>
    <p>Our poisonous overdedication to unsituated virtues is now structural. It is inseparable from the very transactional kind of society we've let usurp the banner of liberalism. Which was the chicken and which was the egg I don't know. But employers no longer offer anything like a lifetime career ladder, while the most skilled professionals often defer, or indeed never take on, very long-term institutional commitments. At a personal level, I'm deeply attached to continual reinvention and nomadism. But into what kind of institutions, what kind of societies, do all we nomads compose? And how does that liberty <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8392.html">affect those less well-placed</a> to pick-up stakes and reinvent themselves when things go awry?</p>
    <p>The incentives of the portable professional are quite different than those of a dedicated lifer. Our careers flit between many firms in the private sector, or many roles and positions in nonprofits or public service. Skills we develop pursuing situated virtues aren't necessarily portable. They don't translate easily into resumé items. Whatever deep institutional know-how we acquire is rendered obsolete with our next pivot. A school board member can use her racial justice activism as a springboard for all kinds of other roles. It constitutes achievement legible to sympathetic outsiders. If she devotes the same energy to quietly organizing conversations, resolving internal disputes, facilitating consensus, all of which contributes to excellences in education provision that may or may not show up in standardized testing? From the outside all she has been is a faceless bureaucrat. She might receive a glowing reference, from a crony.</p>
    <p>So individually, rationally, we look for overlaps between whatever our organizational roles might be and externally legible, unsituated virtues. But by seeking the kinds of achievements that help build our personal brands, we quietly deform institutions that we constitute, and starve them of the kind of work whose dividends are more subtle and collective. We end up with very brilliant people occupying all the roles of very dysfunctional organizations. Increasingly we find ourselves quite explicitly letting pursuit of unsituated virtues override the more specific purposes and goals of the institutions we participate in. (See <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2023/03/04/florida-new-college-what-we-lose-when-we-ignore-stewardship-competence-column/">New College</a>, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/12/audubon-society-claims-intimidation-threats-436215">Audubon Society</a>, etc.)</p>
    <p>This story has a lot of parallels, and touches on a lot of themes I've written about before.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>"Situated versus unsituated virtues" is an institutional analog to <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8511.html">extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation</a> at an individual level.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>I think increasing reliance on <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/26/banks-should-fail-much-more-often/index.html">hard information rather than soft information has destroyed the unique role</a> banks used to play in economic and social development. Abjuring soft information in pursuit of scale has rendered banks little more than crony-capitalist, too-big-to-fail gatekeepers between citizens and the use of state money. Soft information is information that cannot easily be made universally legible and verifiable. Acting on soft-information is necessarily a situated virtue.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>The financial analog of a very transactional social liberalism is the cult of liquidity, which is the <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1209978923.shtml">antithesis of investor commitment</a>. Perhaps firms are better run and managed with investors who must devote some attention and voice to the management of firms they invest in, rather than investors all of whom imagine they can costlessly exit if the firm is mismanaged, or who simply diversify away any care.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometime in the 1980s, I think, David Letterman had on some MENSA person who was allegedly the smartest person in the world. So, he asked, why haven't you cured cancer?</p>
    <p>We have all become that person. More or better education, always the liberal cure-all, is beside the point. It's our institutions that are illiterate, not the individuals who people them.</p>
    <p>Garett Jones wrote a tweet that, more than a decade ago, I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/4218.html">characterized</a> as "the single most insightful economics tweet of all time". He wrote</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Workers mostly build organizational capital, not final output. This explains high productivity per ‘worker’ during recessions.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jones has since deleted this tweet. It was probably already out of date when he penned it. Times have changed, and not for the better.</p>

    <p>On <em>The New York Times'</em> "Matter of Opinion" podcast, Ross Douthat <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/opinion/gen-z-gender-political-ideology.html?showTranscript=1">worries</a> about collapsing birth rates:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>I am interested in the problem of birthrates worldwide and in the developed world, and concerned about the consequences of demographic decline. Modest demographic decline leads to slower economic growth, even potentially negative economic growth. It leads to incredible burdens on old-age pension systems because you don’t have enough younger workers paying into them. And it leads to a lot of alienation and literal physical isolation.</p>
     <p>So if you look, though, at cases, like South Korea — and there are other countries headed rapidly in that direction — we aren’t talking about something an interesting sociological and economic question of, Well, what does society look like as it ages and has fewer kids? We’re looking at the potential for actual crisis and actual collapse.</p>
     <p>South Korea’s fertility rate is in the 0.7s right now, which means roughly for every two people, there is 0.7-ish offspring. If you just project that trend forward, South Korea’s population doesn’t just diminish. It starts to actually collapse over a two-generation time scale.</p>
     <p>...</p>
     <p>[W]hen the problem is, your birth rate is 1.5, and it would be better if it was 2, then it’s a somewhat-normal policy problem. And you can argue about what kind of social safety net you should have. And in those arguments, I have sympathies with liberals.</p>
     <p>I’m one of the conservatives who favors the new child-tax-credit provisions that Congress is considering this week. Those things have the potential to make it economically easier to have and rear kids. And they can affect the birth rate on the margins.</p>
     <p>But there are clearly just deeper, profound cultural forces at work here, which is why this trend shows up everywhere.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Does neoliberalism count as a deeper cultural force?</p>
    <p>A simple definition of neoliberalism is expanding the scope of market logics in regulating human affairs, even into spheres that were traditionally the province of other institutions, like state, church, or family.</p>
    <p>The first result of market logics, the one <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm">extolled by Adam Smith</a>, is division of labor. Each worker should focus and become expert in one very specific aspect of production and then exchange the thing they produce most abundantly and excellently for other things. In aggregate we will then produce much more than if each of us made amateur attempts to produce for ourselves all that we require. "Cottage production", whereby an individual craftsmen artisanally produces all of the stages of a thing — let alone all of the stages of all of the things they might require! — is an epithet in economics. Even the production of pins, Smith famously described, is best meted out to specialists in a variety of tiny steps.</p>
    <p>From an economic perspctive, childrearing is a form of cottage production whose opportunity cost is gargantuan in the form of time misspent by specialists who could be producing valuable things.</p>
    <p>Child-rearing may not be quite as divisible as pin-making. We farm out aspects of education and health care to specialists, but it may be the case that shepherding infants into productive adulthood requires intense, indivisible, relationships with just a few consistent caregivers. Nevertheless, the most basic economic reasoning suggests that these caregivers should be specialists who devote themselves solely to caregiving, who trade the results of their caregiving excellence for the other goods and services they require.</p>
    <p>Market logics are not learned by catechism. They impose themselves invisibly, "naturally", via rewards and punishments embedded in the apparently disjoint choices of people who do or don't transact with us. The inefficient are left alone, and to be left alone is to be left to die. As Karl Marx famously <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm">put it</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>How then, "if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood", in our capitalist and far-from communist societies, should we expect him to be a hunter in the morning and a parent in the evening?</p>
    <p>Demographic transition — collapsing birth rates — is not the puzzle. The puzzle is the continued pervasiveness of cottage parenting despite its inefficiency and cost. Why don't we leave parenting to lower-cost specialists in the developing world and then purchase the workers they produce with nice wages?</p>
    <p>Contra Douthat, precisely becuase the trend shows up everywhere, "deep, profound cultural forces" seem unlikely. Douthat and his colleagues lament that birth rates have collapsed even in European countries with generous "safety nets", and especially in culturally quite distinct South Korea. But neoliberalism broadly construed and the "high-tech late modernity" that constitutes Douthat's antinatal everywhere are the same place.</p>
    <p>Elsewhere I have written that <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5031.html">"'incentives to produce' are incentives to rig the game"</a>. They are equally incentives not to have children. The level of outcome dispersion we've invited in the name of "incentives to produce" means that a child tax credit of one or two or five thousand dollars per child doesn't begin to put a dent in the opportunity cost of raising the child.</p>
    <p>Even the Nordics — the best arranged countries on Earth — can't overcome this. The Nordics do an excellent job of clipping the downside of social outcomes. The state covers many of the basics of childrearing. Nordic countries <a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2023/03/17/fertility-in-europe-which-countries-have-the-highest-and-lowest-numbers-of-live-births-per">do pretty well on birth rates</a> relative to peers of similar wealth. But not well enough to replace their own populations. Neoliberalism suffers also from its upside, from the outsize lives it delivers to those who devote themselves to its games and win.</p>
    <p>The relationship between wealth and natality is nuanced. When wealth is certain, its increase is likely pronatal, as people can bank on greater resources to cover the burdens of childrearing. But when wealth is uncertain, when it is delivered via tournaments that deliver outsize rewards to winners, then increases in "expected" (meaning average) wealth likely translate to <em>decreases</em> in natality. The bigger the prize, the greater the cost of anything that will reduce your chance of winning.</p>
    <p>American conservatives (I'm not accusing Douthat here!) love to sexualize everything. If only we could shove women back into the kitchen, they'd become bored enough to find meaning again in raising a bunch of kids. Maybe so! But that's just a specific case of a general proposition. To the degree that we can clip the opportunities available to households outside of raising kids, then households will choose to raise more kids.</p>
    <p>Instead of insisting women stay home, we might just impose steep levels of taxation at incomes just above what a single devoted earner might achieve. That would end the <a href="https://isbn.nu/0465090907">"two income trap"</a> for upper-middle class families. Affluent households would face little penalty for letting one parent specialize in market income and the other parent focus on childrearing, homemaking, and community-building. Choosing the location of the tax threshold would involve tradeoffs between how broadly in the population we wish to encourage natality versus neoliberal concerns about incentives to produce.</p>
    <p>Alternatively — preferably I think — rather than reducing the opportunity cost of childrearing by putting a tight ceiling on other opportunities, we could increase the payout associated with childrearing. The cost of raising a child well, in direct expenses and the opportunity cost of time, is tens of thousands of dollars per year. Policy encouragements that have been tried and mostly failed are simply nowhere near the relevant magnitudes.</p>
    <p>Adam Smith's ghost still haunts us. If we did compensate child rearing at levels roughly commensurate with its costs, there'd be more kids all around, but a disproportionate share of the new children would likely come from households that efficiently specialize in child rearing rather than seek other forms of market income. I suspect that, for contestable social reasons, we'd dislike that market logic and limit the number of compensated kids per household, or phase-in compensation only with other forms of income.</p>
    <p>But there really is no mystery. In our thoroughly marketized societies, we don't find it odd that other goods and services whose remuneration is lower than the opportunity cost of the inputs they require are meagerly supplied. We don't like to talk that way about children, but it is precisely the same situation. Various social institutions once encouraged childrearing anyway. Neoliberalism is just the project of demoting and eclipsing those.</p>
    <p>To their credit, many social conservatives have now reckoned with the inconsistency between their values and the neoliberal project. However, many of the most prominent contemporary pronatalists come from the tech/crypto/VC space, and have not grappled with or even recognized the contradictions among their allegiances. They have invented a new dialectic — <em>synthesis, antithesis, optimism</em> — and it is enough for them.</p>

    <p>One thing perhaps we can agree is that Israel/Palestine serves as a cautionary tale.</p>
    <p>Israel/Palestine is the story of a failed state. Two populations, which define and distinguish themselves in terms of identities deemed immutable by virtue of history and religion and ethnicity, have failed now for decades to come to some accommodation under which they might peacefully coexist and jointly govern the small sliver of land they occupy between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea.</p>
    <p>If it weren’t for the all the dead bodies, it would almost be farcical. All of these big words — “rights” of national self-determination, of return, claims to history and indigeneity — just obscure and perpetuate and justify failures to address the most basic prerequisites of human flourishing on a territory the size of a postage stamp. It’s like academic politics are so bitter because the stakes are so small. Only now with murder.</p>
    <p>People live in places. People’s welfare is determined much more by the quality of the communities that occupy those places than by anything they can do as individuals. You may be very good at your work. You wouldn’t have done well in Somalia.</p>
    <p>The first prerequisite of flourishing for any geographically situated human community is peace. But peace, Thomas Hobbes <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3207/3207-h/3207-h.htm">reminds us</a>, is not the human default. We are quarrelsome creatures. Peace only obtains when some form of <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6970.html">authority</a> emerges that serves as a basis for coordinating punishment of freelance banditry within a territory, and for coordinating defense against marauders from without.</p>
    <p>Both “nation" and "state” are names we give to this kind of coordinating authority. But the two words suggest quite distinct approaches. A “nation” is a community of people inculcated with some shared sense of who they are and how communal life should be arranged, who generally act in accordance with that sense. Members of a nation discourage violations of that shared understanding almost instinctually. Those who act in accordance with the shared understanding are welcomed in the collaborations that render a community prosperous and lively, while those who defy them face exclusion and stigma, and, for severe violations, improvisationally organized vigilanteism. A "state" is quite different. States are made of formal institutions and laws, written codification of how people are to behave, superintended by a hierarchical body which enforces its authority via a near monopoly in practice over coercive violence.</p>
    <p>The "nation-state" is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTTixlelryY">Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup</a> of human coordination at scale. It takes from nation a commonality of understanding that renders authority largely self-enforcing. It takes from state the stabilizing backstop of coercive enforcement, and also the dynamism that centralized codification — and therefore a centralized capacity for recodification — can engender.</p>
    <p>There are tensions between the two approaches. Laws can change faster than shared understandings. The shared understandings of a nation constitute the sacred. Nation-states must sacralize the everchanging law itself, must inculcate not just an understanding of how we live, but a meta-understanding that how we live is mutably governed. Today’s laws are owed the same reverence today that yesterday’s were owed yesterday, even when they are mutually contradictory. Conversely, the formal bureaucracy of the state must be attentive to and not outstrip the nation’s capacity to make sense of itself. The nation must be able to recognize in the changing law adaptations and improvements of how the community understands itself, rather than its undoing.</p>
    <p>Beyond peace, the quality of a geographically situated community is a function of how effectively and adaptively it can coordinate, and at what scale. A geographically situated community different elements of which are at war (however literally or figuratively) with one another, or are simply not mutually intercoordinating among one another, will be weaker and less prosperous than a community capable of recruiting its full population into coordination with little internal contestation. Holding constant the quality of internal coordination, larger nation-states will enjoy greater prosperity and military power than smaller nation-states. (Small nation-states that seem to defy this logic usually have some much larger patron with which they are deeply integrated in trade and which attends to their defense.) In practice, there are often tradeoffs between scale and quality of coordination. But when those can be overcome, bigger is better.</p>
    <p>So a nation-state is a natural monopoly subject to economies of scale. The essence of a state is a near monopoly in practice over coercive violence. The essence of a nation is a shared understanding that promotes effective coordination across the community. For economies of scale to be realized, mutually compatible, if not identical, understandings of how to act must be widely held. If a nation-state means to prosper and defend itself, it must cultivate some form of national identity that its population will almost universally adopt.</p>
    <p>Historically, the main solution to this problem is assimilation. France becomes a nation-state when it erases its historic provinces, to which grand stories and identities once attached, and replaces them with bureaucratic departments. This was <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/partage/9898-83-departements">openly a project</a> to supplant provincial identities with a new understanding of self and community that would be shared across the full territory of the French state. To this day, the French nation is evangelical and assimilative, willing to make equal citizens of all who enthusiastically adopt its shared self-understanding, discouraging to the point of persecution communities on its territory that insist upon understandings which the larger polity does not deem compatible.</p>
    <p>Ethnostates, on the other hand, are disfavored by the logic I have described. When there exists some prior ethnic group whose traditional self-understanding will serve as the national complement to a formal state, the scale of the nation-state is limited by the scale of that <em>ethnos</em> in the borders of some territory that it dominates.</p>
    <p>Ethnicity is not usually conceived as very permeable. You are of our tribe, or you are not. In a world (our real world) where self-perceived ethnic communities are not well sorted geographically, ethnostates cannot achieve the universality of shared identity that an effective nation-state requires. It will necessarily govern subpopulations not of the nation, for whom coordinating authority will derive primarily from the ungloved fist of the state.</p>
    <p>Hard power without soft power is always fragile power. Repression and especially conflict are costly — in a fiscal sense, but more importantly in potential coordination foregone. Repression and conflict are constant, when people inhabit territory a state claims but are excluded from the nation, from the shared understanding and identity under which citizens conform to state authority even without any proximate threat of coercive violence.</p>
    <p>It is one of history’s typical ironies that “the Jews” and “the Palestinians” have a great deal in common while they murder one another. Both are “nations” whose self-conceptions are incompatible with an inclusive, and therefore effective, state. As long as the narrative that binds each group is membership based on shared history and grievance, each of the nations is necessarily exclusive of the other. The “self-determination” of one in the form of an ethostate requires the continual oppression of the other, poisoning the lives of victor and vanquished alike, unless and until near complete separation or elimination can be achieved. Both Israel and Palestine, as they conceive themselves, are bad projects, practically and ethically. They rot from their seeds.</p>
    <p>But the rest of us ought not rest on our laurels. As the Israelis point out when they complain about “double standards”, there is a little bit of ethnostate in most contemporary nation-states. On the one hand, modern liberal states promise to be states for all their citizens, to provide equal rights and equal dignity to all. On the other hand, the same states privilege language and cultural practices historically associated with one demographically dominant ethnicity.</p>
    <p>Unlike Israel, however, most liberal states tolerate and encourage assimilation by outsiders. Only Jews can be Jews in Israel. Anyone who moves to France or Germany, who adopts and embraces the language or culture, can become German. The United States is so new, and the provenance of its population is so mixed, that its national identity is openly synthetic and syncretic. But the United States has nevertheless constructed a strong national identity, despite little anchoring in any historical ethnicity.</p>
    <p>Modern, liberal nation-states are more resilient than gated ethnostates like Israel, but they are far from infinitely resilient. That word “liberal” often connotes a claim that not only will the state provide equal rights and dignity to individuals who assimilate, but that they will also provide equal rights and dignity to different <em>communities</em>, including communities who choose not to assimilate, who do not join the shared self-understanding that defines the nation tethered to state.</p>
    <p>That claim is a pretense, a dangerous conceit. The nation part of nation-state is not optional. Ethically, we might wish for a world in which states could be neutral between radically diverse communities. But states rely upon citizens having understandings of themselves and of social affairs that, again, need not be identical, but must be mutually compatible. It is the nation in nation-state that enables the citizenry as a whole to mostly govern themselves, resorting only infrequently to deployment of the state’s hard power as an unwelcome but sometimes necessary backstop.</p>
    <p>The function and purpose of nation-states — effective social coordination at very large and impersonal scales — cannot be achieved relying solely or even primarily upon the blunt instrument of direct state power. Shared understandings and customs that become the basis for tacit, automatic, instinctual, decentralized coordination are not optional. A state is only effective if it superintends a nation. A nation is only effective if, beneath the amorphous evolving haze of custom and identity, sits the defining and stabilizing bone structure of a state.</p>
    <p>We are in an era of mass migration, which presents challenges to nation-states, and therefore to the capacity of humanity as a whole to coordinate at scale and prosper at scale, because that happens almost entirely under the auspices of strong nation-states. Our collective failure to achieve “convergence”, under which less developed states would find a path towards matching the prosperity and safety of developed states, means that, for much of the world, migration to a more developed state is your best and perhaps your only strategy to give your kids a decent life. Climate change is likely to supercharge migration pressures, as some places grow too dangerous or barren to support their existing populations.</p>
    <p>Humanity is not a democracy, but a thing about the humans is everybody gets a vote anyway. You may wish we did not face the challenge of mass migration, but the migrants get a vote, and they say that we must in fact face it. You can adopt the MAGA “America First” response to this new era, but to do so is to elect to become Israel, and to pay the costs — military, economic, and moral — that Israel now is paying. If your main response to growing demand for mass migration is to become restrictionist, then you will have to militarize your borders in order to enforce your restrictions. You will have to become authoritarian internally to detect and deport those who have evaded your restrictions, and to manage security threats created by citizens of your own state who will not assimilate to the nation you propose, because they sympathize with migrants.</p>
    <p>Israel is a brittle ethnostate because it cannot or will not bring people who live on its territory or who insist disruptively that they will live on its territory into its national community. It bears large costs to preempt conflicts and to fight them, larger costs in terms of social and economic potential foregone, and worst of all, social deformation, shame, and moral injury from all the murders the path it has chosen does require it to commit.</p>
    <p>The states of North America and Europe will be no different if we place ourselves in the same situation.</p>
    <p>The alternative to Israel is as it has always been America, the America of <em>e pluribus unum</em>. The United States is not, and never has been, a state without a nation. The America I grew up in had a deep and profound national identity. This was not mere “creedal democracy”, the thin, very intellectual idea that our quasi-worship of the Constitution and a few civic ideas was the basis for our common nationhood.</p>
    <p>No, the United States had, and still has, a very thick, tacit and instinctual, national identity. We have customs and a language and weird idioms that we share. We have American food, like pizza, bagels, kung-pao chicken, hamburgers, sushi, and gyro sandwiches. It doesn't matter that these things derive from other nations, or whether they are "authentic" to their roots. They are ours now.</p>
    <p>There is nothing more British these days than having a curry. In Germany you find wonderful kebabs. This reflects the most virtuous form of assimilation, where the shared understanding that defines the nation not only accepts migrants as individuals, but adapts the shared natural culture to include and celebrate what they as communities bring. Host country citizens recognize that they gain from “appropriating” the most congenial bits of migrants’ cultures. America would not be America without pizza! Migrant communities feel more welcome when at least some of their old self-understandings are celebrated by their new communities. They become more willing to walk the challenging, painful, road of ceding much of who they have been and how they understood their world in order to adopt something quite different. When migrants’ “ethnic” commodities — foods or foot massages or whatever — are embraced by home country natives, that helps to lubricate their assimilation economically, as it means there are services they are particularly well-placed to sell. Xenophilia is an incredibly adaptive national characteristic, and it will only be more so going forward.</p>
    <p>When restrictionists in developed countries say they don’t mind, aren’t against, immigration, they just want it to be legal and ordered and organized, that is fine and they are right. We do not want, should not abide a situation where our laws, whose tacit sanctity renders our national success possible, are run roughshod by new migrants that must learn also to hold them sacred if we are to collectively succeed.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, we cannot succeed if the laws we enact are ill adapted to our actual circumstances. To save Miami from sea-level rise, we could ban high tide. We could place militarized cops on the beaches, fire machine guns at each transgressing wave. The tide will still come. Our laws cannot be shaped only by our preferences. Reality will have its say.</p>
    <p>As pressures for mass migration accelerate, we will all become some admixture of Israel, Lebanon, and melting-pot America. Some countries will double-down on restrictionism become small, brutal, deformed shadows of the political communities they might have been. Some will accept the tide of bodies into the territory of their states, but prove unable to merge the diversity of communal identities and worldviews that come with those bodies into a coherent nation, leading to reduced social trust, impairment of the nation-state’s ability to coordinate at scale, bitterness among natives and new immigrants both, conflict, and authoritarianism.</p>
    <p>But some countries will manage what the United States managed in the 19th and 20th Centuries, to accept the bodies but also join the minds of new citizens into a continually evolving understanding of the nation to which they now belong. Countries that manage this will achieve the economies of scale that nation-states can gain from larger populations without bearing the deadweight, deadly costs of interethnic conflict, militarized borders, deterrent brutality.</p>
    <p>No law can make the immigration problem go away. The world is as it is, and the drivers of mass migration are likely to get stronger not weaker. The question before us is not “whether” or “how many”, but “how?” What set of practices and institutions might bring natives and migrants together under a version of national identity sufficiently nimble and attractive and adaptive to join and guide us all?</p>
    <p>For nation-states capable of answering this question, the coming era will be a time of growth, opportunity, and national greatness. For nation-states whose identities and self-understandings are incapable of adapting to integrate large numbers of new migrants, it will be a time of crisis, authoritarianism, decline, bitterness, and shame.</p>
    <p>We’d best get working on how.</p>

    <p>Predictably, <em>The New York Times</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">suing</a> Open AI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. OpenAI has used <em>The Times'</em> text to train their large language models. I have no opinion on the legal merits of the case. Courts will try invent some line between fair use and infringement under existing law that balances various interests in this brave new world of LLMs.</p>
    <p>But I hope that Congress will act to address the question more holistically and creatively than courts can. Here is my two point plan for what Congress should do:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>Congress should declare that big-data AI models do not infringe copyright, but are inherently in the public domain.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Congress should declare that use of AI tools will be an aggravating rather than mitigating factor in determinations of civil and criminal liability.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h4><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/12/28/how-to-regulate-ai/#congress-should-declare-that-big-data-ai-models-do-not-infringe-copyright-but-are-inherently-in-the-public-domain" id="congress-should-declare-that-big-data-ai-models-do-not-infringe-copyright-but-are-inherently-in-the-public-domain" name="congress-should-declare-that-big-data-ai-models-do-not-infringe-copyright-but-are-inherently-in-the-public-domain" class="anchorlink"></a>Congress should declare that big-data AI models do not infringe copyright, but are inherently in the public domain.</h4>
    <p>The moral justification for this is clear. Big-data AI models are summarizations of the work of large publics. They are a whole much greater than the sum of the parts. Their value comes from a public much too broad and amorphous to constitute an identifiable party who might license inputs or be compensated.</p>
    <p>The law should explicitly reject claims like <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/stock/contributor/help/firefly-faq-for-adobe-stock-contributors.html">Adobe’s</a> that, by training models on only work explicitly licensed to them or in the public domain, they address this concern. Even if every individual input dots the i's and crosses the t's of prior copyright law, modeling very large corpuses of work extracts information not only from the direct inputs summarized, which might in theory be compensated, but from all the inputs and influences to the creators of those direct influences.</p>
    <p>These models not simply new creative works derivative of particular other works. The modeling process is something new, a tool designed to extract regularities and patterns and ideas that characterize the domains they model as a whole. The training set is a telescope and a microscope. Their object of study is human creation very broadly, and these fruits of human creation can belong only to humanity writ large.</p>
    <p>In order to immunize themselves from claims of unlawful expropriation, including both old-school copyright claims and new claims on behalf of the public itself, anyone who trains AI models would have an affirmative obligation to publish and place into the public domain both the results of their training — the “weights” — and the structure of the model under which those weights take their meaning, including code, such that people or ordinary skill in the domain could quickly stand up and run new instances of the model.</p>
    <p>This would, you might object, take away some of the incentive to train large models. It would. But the commercial incentives to develop AI models are already very strong. The Microsofts of the world that want to integrate AI tools into their products can easily afford to fund them as loss leaders. Business communities more broadly, who perceive opportunities to increase productivity or reduce labor costs, would find that pooling resources to train open-source models easily pencils. Academics and the public sector would train public models as well.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the training set, you might object that putting these models in the public domain does nothing to put food on the table of the creators whose work is ingested to produce them. That is very true. But it is a common result of new technologies that old activities that once were remunerative cease to be so. <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Marc Andreeson is wrong</a> to imagine that inherent characteristics of technology and capitalism ensure that as some means of subsisting are eliminated, better and more remunerative jobs are sure to replace them because of higher marginal productivity or whatever. At an individual level, many people whose work has been technologically obsoleted suffer harms from which they never fully recover. At a broader level, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/1116.html">only the expansion of social democracy</a> has rendered technological development and something like full employment remotely compatible.</p>
    <p>Widespread use of large-language models will demand a more redistributive state, as much of the public will find these models undermine their (our) current source of market power and therefore ability to command a decent wage. Nevertheless, it remains true that, with decent governance, we are collectively better off when we can all do more with less human work. The right way forward is to continue to let technology make us, in this narrow sense, “richer in aggregate", but use the institution of the state aggressively to ensure that richer in aggregate means all of us live better lives and none of us bestride the narrow world like Elon Musk.</p>
    <p>AI models do nothing at all to hinder human creativity. For many people, generative AI will enable, has already enabled, new means of creative expression. But what is less scarce is less valuable in commerce. It is not creativity that is threatened, but the creative professions.</p>
    <p>I don't think we want market forces to turn 90% of today's creative professionals into nurse's assistants, plumbers, and staff for upscale resorts. Art lives not just in its artifacts, but in collaborative relationships between human artists and audiences, and in forms of collaborations where roles of producer and consumer are less distinct than those terms suggest. The value that we derive from creative work is not independent of who produced it and how. Creative work constitutes the symbols and sinews of human communities. It is the substrate, scaffolding, upon which we develop our notions of the sacred.</p>
    <p>Creativity and capitalism have always sat awkwardly together. They will now sit even more awkwardly. There will be no papering over the divergence between exchange value and value. I don't think we should romanticize the era that is ending. The imperatives of remuneration have recruited beautiful hearts to compellingly sanctify arrangements that are horribly profane. There have been so many beautiful ads.</p>
    <p>We will all still need to eat. We will be less able to pretend that "free markets" can somehow reconcile meeting that need with performing our highest purposes. The challenge we face has always been political. I think it's neither wise nor virtuous to try to suppress generative AI in order to retain a <em>status quo</em> under which some of us could pretend that it was not.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/12/28/how-to-regulate-ai/#congress-should-declare-that-use-of-ai-models-is-an-aggravating-rather-than-mitigating-factor-in-determinations-of-civil-and-criminal-liability" id="congress-should-declare-that-use-of-ai-models-is-an-aggravating-rather-than-mitigating-factor-in-determinations-of-civil-and-criminal-liability" name="congress-should-declare-that-use-of-ai-models-is-an-aggravating-rather-than-mitigating-factor-in-determinations-of-civil-and-criminal-liability" class="anchorlink"></a>Congress should declare that use of AI models is an aggravating rather than mitigating factor in determinations of civil and criminal liability.</h4>
    <p>AI models clearly have a lot of potential uses. But they just as clearly could cause a great deal of harm. AI models can <a href="https://isbn.nu/0553418815">launder</a> what we might otherwise recognize to be invidious discrimination by race or sex. They can render “objective" or “rational” the <a href="https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/">murder of children <em>en masse</em></a>. They can run down pedestrians and then, in their digital confusion, <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/11/15/gm-general-motors-cruise/71586950007/">drag them for twenty feet</a>.</p>
    <p>There’s <a href="https://twitter.com/bumblebike/status/832394003492564993">that slide, usually attributed to an IBM presentation from the 1970s,</a> stating “A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision.” No sentence ever has more completely misunderstood the imperatives of management. Managers, who are inevitably made responsible for much more than they can control, constantly, desperately, seek means of escaping accountabilty for the decisions that they calculate will be in their interest. An <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/">entire, storied industry</a> is based upon serving this compulsion.</p>
    <p>If the public allows it, the first and most important use of LLMs will be to allow managers, firms, and governments to shirk accountability, either by deferring to the expertise of "objective” models, or by blaming inevitable, regrettable glitches that of course we must accept for the greater good while developing any brilliant new technology.</p>
    <p>So the public, via the state, must not allow it. Commercial users of AI models will argue that the law should treat occasional “mistakes” resulting from AI model outputs to be unintended and unforeseeable outcomes of ordinary business processes, for which their liability should be minimal. If the self-driving car hits a pedestrian, that is regrettable, but of course there can be no criminal charges, as there might have been for a human driver who dragged a person 20 feet after striking her. If lots of people are wrongfully denied insurance claims by some black-box model, eventually perhaps some class-action lawsuit will succeed and make some lawyers rich and fail to bring back the dead. The firm will pay a financial settlement, a cost of doing business. Of course, if a human had systematically made the same error, and it was in the firm's or their own financial interest, the human might have been convicted of fraud. But a computer is eternally innocent.</p>
    <p>We should not treat computational models — of any sort, but especially models as unpredictable as LLMs — as legitimate and ordinary decision-making agents in any high-stakes business process. A computer cannot be held accountable, so the law must insist that, by definition, it is never a computer that makes a management decision. If it seems to anyway, and then it errs, the humans who deployed it were presumptively negligent. If it errs systematically in the interest of the firm, its human deployers were presumptively engaged in a conspiracy to defraud.</p>
    <p>An analogy I like to use is alcohol and driving. One way we could think about a person who causes a fatal car crash while intoxicated is that they did not have their wits about them, they did not intend to do the harm. It was a tragic accident when they were not at their best, so their culpability should be limited.</p>
    <p>Another way we can think about the same event is that <em>precisely because</em> after drinking a person would foreseeably not have their wits about them, the very act of drinking without making alternative transportation arrangements increases their culpability for the accident. They should have known well in advance of the tragedy itself they were doing something risky. The risk that they took was essential to the crime, not just the fact of the horrific consequence.</p>
    <p>Each of these framings is legitimate. They just express different social values. If, as a society, we place a very high value on the joys of alcohol-lubricated conviviality and our liberty of automobile-mediated assembly for that purpose, then we might treat intoxication as a mitigating factor in car accidents, and accept their prevalence as a price we pay for a greater good. If we don’t place so high a value on a good time, or we place a much higher value on reducing car accidents, then we would adopt the framing that we have, under which alcohol is an aggravating factor.</p>
    <p>We face a similar social choice with LLMs. The business automation they might enable should be scored as a social good, to the degree they free humans to do either work only humans can do well or to enjoy greater liberty and leisure. But low-quality work and the risk of laundering fraudulent or unethical practices through an ablution of mysterious technology should be viewed as a grave social costs. There is no such thing as perfect balance. We have to decide whether to err on the side of license — on the theory rapid deployment of these technologies will make us richer and happier and better — or of caution, because we think quality of deployment outweighs any benefit of speed. Fifteen years ago, before our collective experience of social media and surveillance capitalism and platform peony, I would have opted for license. Now, however, I strongly favor caution.</p>
    <p>Use of these technologies should not be banned, for almost any purpose. But our social presumption should be they are unreliable, experimental, susceptible to difficult to detect forms of abuse and predation by their deployers. Whenever things go wrong, their deployers are innocent until proven guilty only of the fact of deployment. Once it has been established that they have deployed these technologies in consequential roles, they become presumptively responsible, civilly and criminally, for all the harms wrought by systems they deployed but negligently failed to adequately supervise, or worse.</p>
    <p>That presumption would be rebuttable. If deployers can show that the system they created performs at least as well, caused no more harm than, systems in common use that do not use the technology, then they have not been negligent. Waymo, for example, has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24006712/waymo-driverless-million-mile-safety-compare-human">approached autonomous driving</a> with a great deal more caution than competitors Cruise and Tesla, such that in practice its cars have been much safer than human drivers. So long as this is the case, those responsible for deployment of Waymo vehicles should not be held liable, civilly and criminally, for reckless driving following the very few accidents involving its vehicles that do occur. Cruise and Tesla, on the other hand, would not succeed at rebutting a presumption of negligence.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the proposed legal regime would not be to ban these technologies from business processes. It would be to insist upon their high quality, from a social perspective, and ensure that quality is placed before imperatives that might otherwise lead businesses to profit by externalizing risk and harms.</p>

    <p>Why does it matter that, as I argued in the <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/12/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-international-law/index.html">previous post</a>, “international law” is not law at all, but international affairs are governed by norms?</p>
    <p>It’s important because it changes how we should conduct ourselves completely.</p>
    <p>In a courtroom, you can argue points of law and win, even if many people do not like the verdict. When defense and plaintiff meet in a courtroom, they are not trying to persuade one another, or to persuade a broad audience of spectators. They are appealing to the authority of the state. In a legislature, you can "lobby" a small group to change the law. This will durably change how the authority of the state is wielded, even if much of the public finds it horrifying.</p>
    <p>With norms, there is nothing like this. There is no authority to appeal to. Norms bind only by a continuing consensus of multiple parties who model, enforce, and reinforce them.</p>
    <p>Norms can certainly be codified. I am a great fan of <a href="https://www.missmanners.com/">Miss Manners</a>. Whether those codifications matter at all depends on whether some community continually agrees to be bound by them. When disputes arise, it is never enough to be “right on the merits", whatever you might think that should mean.</p>
    <p>In any dispute, it is not just the belligerents that are on trial, but also the norms themselves. The space of putative norms is large and contains contradictions. I condemn you aloud for farting at the dinner party. You condemn me for calling attention to a phenomenon that, Miss Manners will remind us, socially does not exist. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/">AITA</a>? It doesn’t matter which transgression some book says is more serious. The matter is decided by to whom the eyerolls and subtle turning-aways are directed.</p>
    <p>The habits of command are counterproductive in a normative context. Humans value their own agency. Badgering people to accept a norm you favor can prompt defiance. Norms are enforced by mutual consent. You must invite and persuade rather than demand. In any dispute over a putative transgression of norms, you can bribe or threaten to force others to take your side. But then rather than reinforcing the norm you ostensibly were upholding, you have undermined it. The norm you have reinforced is that people behave only transactionally, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_goo">gray goo</a> of norms, undoing all others.</p>
    <p>In international affairs, we really do want a “rules-based order”. But what those rules are can be no ones to command. Over the past two decades, the United States has collapsed from a soft power to a hard power, has traded persuasion in significant measure by a kind of moral prestige for the crude application of carrots and sticks. Do whatever we say is good or we’ll sanction you.</p>
    <p>But hard power is weak power, finite and exhaustible. Only soft power delivers resilience and longevity. As we go forward — those of us who manage to go forward without being murdered or bombed or recruited into some madman’s campaign to murder and bomb — I hope that we can return to soft power. Not unilaterally. Soft power is not zero sum. Our good reputation need not rely upon others having a poor reputation.</p>
    <p>“International law” cannot be a substitute for mutually-reinforced norms. International law only has any meaning downstream from such norms. It has no other method of enforcement. A strange mix of idealism and careerism has led us to devote tremendous energy to an edifice of high-minded codification while neglecting the invisible foundation upon which it must rest. The result has been weaponized sanctimony rather than international peace.</p>
    <p>We do want a rules-based order. Where are these rules written, asks Vladimir Putin, and who has written them? They are good questions, but there can be no document. Russia and the United States both can bomb and bribe, can make high-minded speeches, write manifestoes, whatever. The United Nations can declare whatever it wants.</p>
    <p>But the rules are written in how we collectively behave, not in anything Anthony Blinken or Sergey Lavrov or Wang Yi can proclaim, or that the United Nations might ratify. We can only write the rules together. Those who demand deference rather than earn respect ultimately have the least say in their composition. Unfortunately, anyone can contribute to their decomposition.</p>

    <p>The United States’ diplomatic establishment likes to talk about a thing called the “rules-based order”, and to cite others, like Russia invading Ukraine, for violations of it. Vladimir Putin, for his part, <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/584993-putin-rules-based-order/">has asked</a> where are these rules written, and who gets to write them? One has to concede that these are good questions.</p>
    <p>A more academic exposition of Putin’s position can be found in <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/choice-before-us-international-law-or-a-rulesbased-international-order/7BEDE2312FDF9D6225E16988FD18BAF0">this essay by John Dugard</a>, which contrasts the "rules-based order" with "international law”, on the presumption that "international law" is legitimate. He describes, and ultimately endorses, a view of the rules-based order “as the United States’ alternative to international law, an order that encapsulates international law as interpreted by the United States to accord with its national interests, ‘a chimera, meaning whatever the US and its followers want it to mean at any given time’.”</p>
    <p>He’s right enough about the “rules-based order”. But he’s wrong, in my view, that there is some more legitimate project, “international law”, which the United States’ malleable alternative undermines.</p>
    <p>International law is a cargo cult. It has founding documents and esoteric codes and courts that interpret them, just like national legal systems do. All of that is masturbatory and ultimately quite destructive, in my view. It adds a liturgical patina of law to a set of practices that cannot operate as law. International law cannot come anywhere near keeping its end of the most basic bargain that the law makes to those whom it binds: If you conform, you will be protected.</p>
    <p>Obviously that six word formulation of the basis of law needs caveats and elaboration. Sometimes, for example, the law compels a person to fight and to die for their country, quite the opposite of protection. Sometimes the law requires that a person who has committed no crime must leave their home, even when they have no other destination but the streets. Just exactly what the law protects of those whom it binds is always a matter of contestation. But at a minimum it means that those who abide the law will be treated equitably when the coercive power of the state is brought to bear. Similarly situated citizens will be treated similarly, and the basis for state discrimination, when citizens are seen not to be similarly situated and can be treated differently, must be widely accepted and adhered to for a body of coercive practice to be understood as law.</p>
    <p>For example, Jim Crow law was, from the vantage of today, not law at all, just a law-like patina on a practice of oppression. From the vantage of its own time, whether it was law depends upon just how universally its discriminations were accepted and adhered to. To the degree those subject to its very invidious discriminations internalized and accepted its distinctions — even if they disliked them and could argue against them in theory — then it did function as law. Once sizable classes of people did not accept those dinstinctions, and began actively to resist the "law", well, then it ceased to function as law at all. Legal order was only restored in the United States by revising the putative law to a version that the law’s resisters would accede to, and using the coercive power of the state when necessary to overpower and demoralize the resistance that same revision of the order provoked.</p>
    <p>Legal order might have been restored the other way, by overpowering and demoralizing Jim Crow’s resisters, instead of those who resisted civil rights. That a thing is law does not mean it is good. It just means that it performs a function that is prerequisite to the form of social order provided by modern states. Food is necessary for life, and Cheetos perform the function of food, but that doesn’t mean there are no important distinctions to be made between a fine meal and Cheetos.</p>
    <p>International law is <em>not even</em> not-law in the way that Jim Crow became not-law when postwar social movements rendered it illegitimate and widely resisted. Fundamentally law is a bargain between citizens who generally abide it and a state that holds both a monopoly on legitimate violence and a near monopoly in practice over violent coercion. If adherence to the law purchases equitable treatment when the coercive power of the state is brought to bear, then it buys nothing at all if there is no state, if there is no entity with a near monopoly on violent coercion that distinguishes those who abide the law from those who do not. International law is not in crisis, the way American law came into crisis in the 1950s and 1960s. "Law" is simply a construct that cannot be meaningfully applied to the international order as currently constituted.</p>
    <p>Without any institution that credibly stands in for the “state", without a coherent agent that holds a monopoly on legitimate violence and a near monopoly in practice over violent coercion, to use the word "law” is to perform exactly the kind of rhetorical legerdemain that John Dugard accuses of the "rules based order”. It becomes a loose, flimsy tactic for importing an aura of legitimacy to whatever outcome one might be pursuing.</p>
    <p>Israel is committing crimes against international law, say its critics. For the record, I agree at a moral level with those critics. Israel’s prosecution of its current war is morally indefensible. I would shed few tears for a Netanyahu at Nuremberg. But a few days ago, the security counsel by its duly chartered procedure declined to demand a cease fire which — in the unlikely event that Israel complied — would have halted those “crimes”. Do those who say Israel’s practices are war crimes under international law now stand corrected, since the body closest to a supreme international legal institution has declined to intervene?</p>
    <p>When the US Supreme Court declines to proscribe partisan gerrymandering, those of us who are outraged understand that means the practice has essentially been legalized, at least until Congress or a future Court changes the situation. Partisan gerrymandering is abhorrent, a deep violation of democratic and ethical norms, but it is legal in the United States. Similarly, prior to the overturning of Roe vs Wade, there were plenty of state-level statutes “on the books” forbidding abortion, but as they were unenforceable, nobody mistook them for law.</p>
    <p>Are international law proponents willing to say, following the United States’ veto under duly authorized procedures of the United Nations Security Counsel, that Israel’s continuing war on Gaza is legal? (Yes, some of its tactics might still be judiciable at an International Court for Justice, whose edicts Israel has in the past ignored without consequence.) The Security Counsel could have intervened against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but it has not and would vote (veto) down any attempt to do so. Then isn’t that invasion also legal?</p>
    <p>Of course proponents of international law will not say that. Because proponents of international law don’t actually mean anything like what we mean by law in a nation-state context. No less than America’s “rules-based order”, international law contains an explosion of mutually contradicting verbiage and ideals, and there is no identifiable entity whose actual behavior supervenes into a coherent set of expectations to which some body of citizens (or states, in an international context) might mutually conform.</p>
    <p>There’s no such thing as international law. And yet global affairs are far from anarchic. How do we actually organize and sustain the (remarkably high!) degree of peace and interchange that prevails?</p>
    <p>World affairs, like the vast majority of human affairs, are governed not by laws but by norms. If we want to think clearly about “the world order”, and to prevent the various apocalypses its breakdown might occasion, we’ll have to think more clearly than we have about the distinction, about how norms work rather than laws.</p>

    <p>Matt Yglesias has a piece today called “<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/obama-mostly-got-things-right">Obama mostly got things right</a>”. I expected to disagree with it, because I think Barack Obama was the most destructive political figure of my lifetime. But I agree with much of it! Yglesias just skips everything important, so he can sound contrarian now that the Democratic Party has actually managed to learn something.</p>
    <p>Yglesias cops to errors of the Obama administration, such as the ARRA stimulus being too small, setting the economy up for a decade of demand deficiency. But he points out, correctly enough, that too small a check in a tough political environment represents not some grand mistake, but navigating trade-offs imperfectly.</p>
    <p>Yglesias is less defensibly revisionist when he writes “insufficient stimulus would generate a midterm wipeout that would bring several years of needless austerity budgeting as a knock-on consequence.” Obama actively embraced austerity, and nobody made him. In 2010, before the great shellacking, he made “belt-tightening”, budgeting the Federal government like a household, a centerpiece of his <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address">State of the Union address</a>. Yglesias, at least, is smart enough to understand that during an era of demand deficiency, government finances are nothing at all like household finances and "belt tightening” by the state is dumb. Call it MMT, or just Keynes' Paradox of Thrift. As far as anyone can tell, Obama sincerely believed of the economy in 2010 what Yglesias believes of the economy today, that expenditure by the Federal government was unaffordable, that it crowded out (rather than crowding in) important alternative activity. Obama preached the gospel of deficit reduction when the unemployment rate was nearly 10%.</p>
    <p>Okay. Whatever. Obama had inherited the Clinton/Greenspan “responsible fiscal policy” orthodoxy. Treated as a timeless truth rather than a circumstance-contingent tactic, that orthodoxy is mistaken and destructive. But it’s a small piece of why Barack Obama’s presidency was a catastrophe.</p>
    <p>Barack Obama ran as a transformational figure, and in 2008, the United States needed a transformational figure. “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/11/05/96624326/transcript-of-barack-obamas-victory-speech">I will ask you join in the work</a> of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for 221 years — block by block, brick by brick, callused hand by callused hand.” He blazed into the political scene, and won the nomination from Hillary Clinton on a promise to govern differently. But instead he governed assiduously the same, exactly in the Clintonite tradition. When in power, he shut out and mocked the very people he had seduced during his campaign. He was an outsider who reveled in having made it to the inside, to the very pinnacle of the halls of power. He partied with Larry Summers rather than throw open the doors to the ball.</p>
    <p>By 2008, America was “coming apart” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_Apart_(book)">Charles Murray’s apt phrase</a>). But that was as invisible to the United States' political class as the opioid epidemic had been in 2016, until Donald Trump brought it to the fore. Railing against <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/68.html">Wall Street and Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/55.html">inequality</a> was thankless work, then. The center of American politics saw these things more as triumphs than problems. The public was experiencing decline and tragedy that their leaders perceived not at all. Barack Obama — in his rhetoric much more than his track record, but rhetoric is what built his "movement” — promised a change. Yes we can! Hope! The fierce urgency of now!</p>
    <p>Then he got elected, and became as blind as the rest of them.</p>
    <p>He still gave great speeches sometimes. Barack Obama can speak amazingly, his words radiating perception and empathy and wisdom. But juxtaposed against how he actually governed, the remarkable quality of those speeches came to seem more like narcissistic celebration of the speaker’s talents than any part of the work of healing the world.</p>
    <p>How did Obama govern? What did he do that was so bad? I agree with Yglesias that the too-small ARRA stimulus was an error, not some great betrayal. I also agree with Yglesias that Obama’s universalistic approach to the politics of race was far better than the strident, performative antiracism that now dominates progressive politics.</p>
    <p>But you discredit even the best of your ideals when you sell your coalition out. That’s the heart of it. Obama inherited a financial crisis that represented the market system itself working desperately to course-correct, to undo some of the concentration of wealth and power three decades of bad policy and exuberant malinvestment had engendered. “My administration,” he <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/48854/obama-bankers-beware-the-pitchforks">told the bankers</a>, “is the only thing between you and the pitchforks.” The public, pitchforks in hand, observed just that.</p>
    <p>Barack Obama, Timothy Geithner, Larry Summers steered us through the Great Financial Crisis. When it was over, banking and financial power were more concentrated than they ever had been, while millions of Americans had lost their homes as programs ostensibly designed to help them were cynically administered instead to “<a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/05/14/this_man_made_millions_suffer_tim_geithners_sorry_legacy_on_housing/">foam the runway</a>” for banks, in Geithner’s memorable phrase. The Great-Gatsby-ish world that people like Geithner and Summers — and now Barack Obama too — inhabit had been saved. The few factories that remained were still fleeing to China. Great tracts of the remains of someone’s American dream were getting looted for copper in Maricopa County.</p>
    <p>People who had voted for Obama, who had placed their hopes and dreams in his soaring rhetoric, his promise of change, were left devastated. White midwesterners became so-called Obama-to-Trump voters. They understandably perceived the “progressivism” for which Obama was hope-poster-child to be a sham, a shell game, a self-congratulatory exercise by a class of people who disdain them, exclude them, pretend to help them even while they prey upon them, mock and of course deplore them for the slightest transgression of their pieties. The less white part of the Obama coalition, a Black middle class which seemed briefly, finally, to be joining an American Dream of building wealth through homeownership, was decimated by the Obama presidency. The very same disillusionment that drove the white working class to Trump brought a renaissance of the muscular racial politics of the 1970s, renarrated through the kind of ideas that thrive in academia because their cleverness and radicalness and intentionally obscured simplicity render them useful for persuading colleagues and students that you are cool and worthy of tenure. The “Progressive left” (Yglesias’ “Lizard People”) and downscale MAGA voters are polarized now into enemy camps, but they are sisters and brothers sprung from the same seed.</p>
    <p>Joe Biden, to his very great credit, understands this.</p>
    <p>Yglesias is clear that he dislikes contemporary progressive racial politics. Yglesias mocks the anti-austerity economic coalition he was once — but with unusual sophistication, of course — an active part of, for allegedly not getting that their recommendations need to change with macroeconomic times. (This is a bit ironic in a piece rehabilitating Obama.)</p>
    <p>Yglesias refers to people (like me!) who were “not enthusiastic about Biden in the 2020 primary but have been pleasantly surprised by his openness to Lizardism on a range of topics.” Is Yglesias not enthusiastic about Biden’s Lizardism? What does he think of the problem of <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/">economic concentration</a>, and Biden’s clear support for reviving an antitrust tradition focused on ensuring dispersion of economic power broadly, rather than consumer welfare narrowly construed in prices? Was Biden's appointment of Lina Khan bad Lizardism? How about the Biden administration’s labor policy, his willingness to actually walk a UAW picket line, his NLRB's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-unionize-illegal-union-busting-nlrb-rules-2023-8">making the price</a> of being found to union-bust instant recognition of the union? What does Ygesias think of the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/27/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-renewing-american-economic-leadership-at-the-brookings-institution/">New Washington Consensus</a>?</p>
    <p>I know what I think. I think Joe Biden has learned something from the catastrophe that was his prior administration, and is finally, at long last, beginning the work that Barack Obama promised, “block by block, brick by brick, callused hand by callused hand.” I am shocked that this man — the Senator from MBNA who famously jousted with Elizabeth Warren in service of debt peonage — has in a quiet way begun the sort of economic transformation the United States desperately requires. If Joe Biden is on the ballot in 2024, I will vote <em>for</em> him, and it will only be the second time in my 54 years that I will be voting <em>for</em> anyone, rather than against the other guy, in a US general Presidential election.</p>
    <p>The first time was for Barack Obama.</p>

     <li>
      <p>a right of existence of two "peoples" who view themselves as distinct and mean to maintain their distinctions;</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>each people's "right" to national self-determination;</p></li>

    </ol>
    <p>If you want to keep [1], [2], and [3], you must abrogate [4] and [5]. That's the two-state solution.</p>
    <p>If you want to keep [3], [4], and [5], you must abrogate [1] and [2]. That's the binational liberal democracy solution.</p>
    <p>The worst people on both sides of the conflict emphasize all of these rights at once.</p>
    <p>Both Israeli settlers and from-the-river-to-the-sea Palestinians cede no ground on [4] and [5].</p>
    <p>Likud and Hamas are entirely agreed in their demand for [1]. They are entirely averse to any kind of melting pot assimilation between the two peoples.</p>
    <p>Neither side will accept as legitimate colonial rule by some third power. Neither will accept second-class status beneath the other "people”, whether <em>de jure</em> (as the stateless Palestinians have endured, but do not accept) or <em>de facto</em>, due to demographic outcomes under notionally equal suffrage.</p>
    <p>Right [2] is nonnegogtiable, and right [3] is not consistent with [2] unless demographics can be engineered, which would contradict rights [4] and [5] and invite charges of ethnic cleansing.</p>
    <p>There is, however, one right that maximalists on both sides of the conflict are mutually willing to compromise upon.</p>
    <ol start="0">
     <li>The right of human beings to live in peace and safety, and not see their children murdered or made into murderers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If none of Rights [1] through [5] will be ceded, then Right [0] must give way.</p>
    <p>The worst people on both sides of the conflict emphasize rights [1] through [5] all at once.</p>
    <p>And so has the “international community”, for decades.</p>
    <p>Sanctimonious application of a human rights regime laden with internal tensions and contradictions guarantees that eventually some rights will give way. Maximalists can credibly condemn any proposed compromise as an illegitimate abrogation of rights, and so forestall any action they dislike that might reduce the tensions.</p>
    <p>The predictable effect is that some of these rights will give way all at once, in a crisis, provoking what will correctly be perceived as a terrible injustice to one or both of the parties.</p>
    <p>On Right [0] there has been a great deal of compromise already. Unfortunately that leaves partisans of both communities even more determined to exercise the other rights.</p>
    <p>Right [0] is the only claim that ought ever have been codified into a universal human right. The rest are legitimate aspirations, but human beings and human communities have conflicting, mutually inconsistent aspirations that somehow have to be managed.</p>
    <p>Canonicalizing a broad range of such aspirations into "rights" — which we sanctimoniously promise to uphold (but in practice uphold selectively, because they would be impossible to uphold universally, and of course our selection may not be even-handed) — has been a bloody, catastrophic, mistake.</p>

    <p>Tony Judt’s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292994/postwar-by-tony-judt/"><em>Postwar</em></a> includes in its first chapter the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>At the conclusion of the First World War it was borders that were invented and adjusted, while people were on the whole left in place. After 1945 what happened was rather the opposite: with one major exception boundaries stayed broadly intact and people were moved instead...</p>
     <p>The term ‘ethnic cleansing’ did not yet exist, but the reality surely did—and it was far from arousing wholesale disapproval or embarrassment.</p>
     <p>...</p>
     <p>With certain exceptions, the outcome was a Europe of nation states more ethnically homogenous than ever before... The ancient diasporas of Europe—Greeks and Turks in the south Balkans and around the Black Sea, Italians in Dalmatia, Hungarians in Transylvania and the north Balkans, Poles in Volhynia (Ukraine), Lithuania and the Bukovina, Germans from the Baltic to the Black Sea, from the Rhine to the Volga, and Jews everywhere—shriveled and disappeared. A new, ‘tidier’ Europe was being born.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Branko Milanovic <a href="https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/democracy-of-convenience-not-of-choice">makes a similar point</a> about Eastern Europe in the aftermath of the Cold War:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>When one draws the line from Estonia to Greece, or to be more graphic and to imitate Churchill from Narva to Nafplion, one notices that all currently existing countries along that axis were during the past several centuries (and in some cases, the past half-millennium), squeezed by the empires: German (or earlier by Prussia), Russian, Habsburg, and Ottoman. All these countries fought, more or less continuously, to free themselves from the imperial pressure, whether it was exerted through cultural assimilation (as in the case of Czechs and Slovenians), imperial conquest and partition (Poland), imperial conquest <em>tout court</em> (the Baltics and the Balkans), temporary inclusion as a second-tier ruling nation (Hungary) or any other way.</p>
     <p>Their histories are practically nothing but unending struggles for national and religious emancipation (when the religion of the conqueror differed from theirs, as in the case of Ottomans and the Orthodox, or as between Catholics and Protestants). &nbsp;National emancipation meant the creation of a nation-state that would ideally include all members of one’s community...</p>
     <p>[W]hen the last such empire, the Soviet Union, collapsed all countries along the Narva-Nafplion line became independent and almost wholly ethnically homogeneous.</p>
     <p>...</p>
     <p>[The 1989 revolutions] were often interpreted as democratic revolutions. Thus the current “backsliding” of East European countries toward overt or covert authoritarianism is seen as a betrayal of democratic ideals or even, more broadly and extravagantly, of the ideals of the Enlightenment. The refusal to accept migrants is regarded as contradicting the nature of the revolutions. This is however based on a misreading of the 1989 revolutions. If they are, as I believe they should be, seen as revolutions of national emancipation, simply as a latest unfolding of centuries-long struggle for freedom, and not as democratic revolutions per se, the attitudes toward&nbsp;migration and the so-called European values become fully intelligible. These values, in Eastern eyes, never included ethnic heterogeneity within their borders. For Westerners this may be an obvious implication of democracy and liberalism, but not for the Easterners who are asked to risk their key accomplishment in order to satisfy some abstract principles.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For many of us in the West, the postwar era, beginning after 1945, accelerating after 1989, appeared to be a triumph of liberalism. Things were broadly getting better, most immediately for ourselves, but also for the world. One could quibble about the inauthenticity and unmanliness of the “last man”, but this <a href="https://isbn.nu/0743284550">"end of history"</a>, considering the other ways we feared that history might end, seemed overall like a triumph.</p>
    <p>History has jolted back to life. It resumed its customary pastime of contriving our deaths, <em>en masse</em>. But we really did live in better times, for a while. There was a good trajectory that we failed to sustain. Perhaps, of course, it was unsustainable. Perhaps some inherent contradictions of our collective condition doom us to collapse. There is and was nothing to be done.</p>
    <p>But perhaps we just misunderstood some things about how our successes actually worked, and therefore made some mistakes.</p>
    <p>It will be no surprise to readers of <em>interfluidity</em> that I consider the strain of economic liberalism that we now call "neoliberalism" to have been mistaken. In my view, however, the mistake should not be colored in the broad strokes it often is. The problem was not <em>capitalism bad, socialism good</em>, either of which conjectures (or their opposites) I would describe as hopelessly grand and stupid.</p>
    <p>At its roots, the mistake was that Western economists mistook ends for means. We want, as an <em>end</em>, to live in an economy where the contested outcomes of everyday life are resolved by decentralized markets that masquerade as natural forces, because we don’t go on murder sprees against hurricanes like we do against people we identify as dispossessing us. We want that market economy to yield prosperity, and a prosperity sufficiently equitable that our societies can be cohesive and classless, under which our interests are sufficiently shared that democracy doesn’t degrade to negative-sum factionalism. We want our market economy to be resilient to disruptions in far-flung supply chains, and to be adaptable to production of goods required for a muscular national defense, so we can sustain credible deterrence and support the peace upon which prosperity must depend.</p>
    <p>These are all good things to want! They are ends. The neoliberal error was to posit that the ends themselves were sufficient as means. We needed simply to rely upon markets ever more expansively and naively and incautiously and then, by virtue of some divine coincidence (actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_coincidence">a term of art</a> in economics!), all of our desires would be achieved. Markets — if they are regulated in the manner a certain priesthood defined as “deregulated” — would engender prosperity too cheap to meter. A sufficiently prosperous society would simply purchase every social good we might want. QED.</p>
    <p>Entropy is a fact of social affairs even more than it is a fact of physics. If we want many different things, we will have to expend work and effort towards each of those things, and navigate tradeoffs between our various ends and the means required to achieve them. There will be no divine coincidence. The ends that we desire will make competing demands upon our limited resources. Letting the form of the ends stand-in for intelligent consideration of means — let’s “unleash the free-market economy!” — becomes a catastrophic kind of cargo-cult.</p>
    <p>My liberal-to-left-ish readers can mostly nod along to this, I think. We’ve been persuaded for a while that the “neoliberal turn” was a disaster (even the many of us, including me, who once upon a time were enthusiasts).</p>
    <p>My liberal-to-left-ish readers might have a harder time with what comes next. I think we are making the same mistake with the social and moral aspects of liberalism that we have made with the economic aspects. We mistake ends for means.</p>
    <p>What get called “human rights” are good things. People should have freedom first and foremost to live in safety, exempt from torture or having their children murdered in front of them. People should be able to express themselves freely, to say what they think without fear of violent reprisal. People of the world’s many different religious, cultural, ethnic, racial traditions and identities should be able to live and raise their children within those traditions, wherever they might live. They should not face dispossession, or forced transfer, or extermination because of their traditions and identities. While no one should ever be forced to migrate, people of any tradition should be able to choose to migrate, and wherever they choose to go, they should also be able to live within their tradition, and speak their language with one another. While there may be some legitimate grounds by which states restrict immigration, restrictions based on the religious, cultural, racial, or ethnic, or linguistic identity of potential migrants are not legitimate, are racism or some other form of invidious discrimination.</p>
    <p>All of these are desirable ends! But there are, to put it very mildly, tensions between them, and between these goods and broader ends, like effective <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/31/state-as-coordination/index.html">social coordination at the scale of a nation-state</a> in service of prosperity and defense.</p>
    <p>Freddie deBoer likes to <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/you-cant-just-say-oh-that-doesnt">mock</a> a “progressive tendency to act as though every political question has already long been settled and its answer obvious to all good people”. One example of this, I think, is to make demands for human rights as though they can simply be provided, as if to will the end is sufficient to create the means.</p>
    <p>Securing peaceful coexistence — let alone productive coordination — between human communities that perceive themselves as having distinct identities is the most persistent, recurrent, and vexing problem in all of human history. You can universal-declaration anything you want. Ratification by the UN that a good should exist does not will the good into existence. If you want a social good actually to obtain, you will have to attend carefully to means, and accept that, in practice, you will have to navigate contradictions and trade offs between the goods that you desire.</p>
    <p>The absolute language of rights — “inalienable”, “universal” — and its obverse, <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/10/17/the-rhetoric-of-condemnation/index.html">the rhetoric of condemnation</a>, make thinking clearly about these tradeoffs difficult. A tradition rooted in the prevention of extermination may in practice help to provoke extermination, as the language of rights takes compromise off the table, and the rhetoric of condemnation becomes a sanctified form of dehumanization.</p>
    <p>The neoliberal turn, which it’s easy now to deride as idiot cargo-cultism, appeared to work for about 30 years. The way I’d explain that is, well, there’s a lot of ruin in a social democracy. The period from the end of World War II until the middle 1970s created extraordinary societies in the West, shockingly prosperous and cohesive. During that period, policymakers took seriously that good economic ends required application of diverse and muscular social means. Courts enforced antitrust law based on a positive view that economic power should be widely dispersed, rather than narrow claims of “market failure”. Social institutions, from corporations to unions to civil society organizations, were understood and regulated in broad terms, rather than caricatured as the profit-maximizing agents of economic models. The social democratic era created circumstances following which a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1088-4963.2011.01201.x">parasitic</a> neoliberalism could seem to thrive, for a while. We could deceive ourselves and believe liberalism was working.</p>
    <p>Since World War II, in the West, social liberalism seemed broadly to be working as well. Western countries enshrined universalistic approaches to human rights into law, and thrived, culturally as well as economically. Pluralistic liberalism, invented, arguably, to calm Europe’s religious wars centuries before, now seemed able to manage national and ethnic rivalries and keep an initially unlikely peace.</p>
    <p>But has it actually worked? Did liberalism succeed, or did the ethnic cleansing that didn’t yet have a name at the end of World War II create conditions under which ethnonational rivalries were just easier to manage than thay had previously been? Should we understand postwar Europe to be a triumph of pluralism? Or did the triumph belong to a paroxysm of ethnic cleansing that left nation-states sufficiently homogeneous and cohesive that they could afford a kind of magnanimity? It is much easier to avoid ethnic strife when a dominant group’s hegemony is assured than when multiple groups must either share power or meaningfully contend for dominance.</p>
    <p>I am not a “post-liberal”. The end I seek is a liberal, pluralistic society in which the claims we call human rights are respected as broadly and fully as possible. I’m a “social democrat”, because I would also include various positive economic goods among those claims — “rights” to education, housing, health care, etc.</p>
    <p>But precisely because I seek those end, I want to take seriously the question of means. I understand that there are trade-offs and contradictions between the various rights to which I think we should aspire. Simply declaring and sanctifying a panoply of rights, and condemning in moral terms any abrogation, does not strike me as a recipe for achieving and broadening the purchase of those rights.</p>
    <p>On the contrary.</p>

    <p>World War II was objectively a much more horrible war. Many more people were killed, maimed, displaced than during the first World War. It was “total war”, in which the distinction between combatant and civilian was erased.</p>
    <p>Despite all of that, despite the carpetbombing of Dresden and the burning of Tokyo and the two atom bombs, we came out of that war with a notion that it had been “worth it”, that the good guys had defeated the bad guys.</p>
    <p>War is never worth it. World War II was perhaps the single worst event in all human history.</p>
    <p>That is not to say that the allies should not have fought and won and defeated the Nazis. Of course a counterfactual of capitulation to monsters could be even worse than our current catastrophe of a timeline. What it is to say is that even in 1939, with the literal Hitler gesticulating like a drunken scarecrow before ranks of jackbooted thugs, if there had been any possible means of deterring or preventing the German army’s march, that would have been better, even though it would have left that evil regime in place. Tens of millions of lives would have been spared, inconceivable suffering would have been avoided, and we today might be less stupid.</p>
    <p>What about the Jews? No one can say for sure, but I suspect even for them (for us, it’s my own ethnicity however much I flee it), it would have been better. Without the more universal institution of wartime forced-labor camps, the extermination camps that distinguish the Nazi genocide of the Jews from history’s many, so many, “ordinary” genocides might never have been, umm, innovated. The Jews of Germany might have been persecuted, detained and mistreated like the Uighurs of China today, or simply terrorized, randomly murdered, and expropriated until they were driven to emigrate. All of that is horrible. One can take a certain satisfaction that the Nazis were utterly destroyed and discredited. But for the Jews, the cost of that satisfaction was probably not worth the escalation of persecution into an industrial supply chain of forced labor and cyanide gas.</p>
    <p>We have whitewashed the war. We had trials at Nuremberg which we called justice. And, to be sure, those who were condemned thoroughly deserved their fates.</p>
    <p>But was it “justice” when by the very definitions we were then inventing and formalizing for “war crimes”, many of our own leaders and soldiers could also have been condemned, but were not? It was victor’s justice, which is the only justice war ever brings. We foolishly encased it in a patina of sanctimony which has blinded us ever since to the ineradicable awfulness of war.</p>
    <p>War is crime.</p>
    <p>There are times when crime is necessary. I would steal bread to feed my child, but I would still become a thief. I would take up arms to defend my country, but I would still become a murderer. Whenever crime is necessary, there has been a profound social failure. The work, the main work to which the human spirit is devoted, organizing ourselves for mutual survival and prosperity, has collapsed.</p>
    <p>Yes, war is sometimes necessary. But it is never good. It is the rotten fruit of the very worst human failure.</p>
    <p>Political leaders sometimes see war as opportunities for glory. That is obscene. Leaders on whose watch war has emerged should presumptively be scorned, shamed. Whatever the conflict, among states or between factions, that led to war should be adjudicated by any and every other means. The only redemption for leaders so terrible, so miserable, so condemned and condemnable as to allow a war to begin on their watch is to stop the horror quickly, to find ways neither to capitulate nor to fight, but to compete on less destructive terms.</p>
    <p>Nothing deformed the United States as a political community more than our victory in World War II. Again, I’m not condemning the fighting or winning of that war, to the degree it could not have been prevented or staunched. We are all criminals for Dresden and Hiroshima, but our adversaries also were criminals, and much worse outcomes were possible than the one we achieved.</p>
    <p>But we told ourselves a story of good and evil, we were good and they were evil. We went on for decades imagining ourselves to be comic-book heroes, despite growing body counts in Indochina and North Korea and the Middle East. Our culture is now dominated by literal comic-book universes in which violence against evil is depicted as the way we pursue the good. But propounding evils that merit violence is how the devil farms our souls. Violence multiplies evils. It does not quell them.</p>
    <p>Russia thinks of World War II as its good war as well. Its new invasion, it says, is denazification. Maybe if you cannot see the corpse this idolatry has bred in your own mirror, you can see the corpses now multiplying in theirs.</p>
    <p>Wars end in exhaustion, misery, and catastrophe, whichever flag last stands. World War II was not a good war. Beyond a certain point, it was necessary to fight it, but the world should never have reached that point. If the war could have been deterred by a less yielding and better armed Chamberlain, it should have been deterred.</p>
    <p>Deterred. To be against war unfortunately is not to be against arms. Unfortunately, deterrence is often a precondition for keeping the peace. However, the more deterrence is relied upon, the more catastrophic when it breaks. Deterrence by denial is superior to deterrence by punishment. States should rely as much as is necessary but as little as is possible on threat of reprisal to keep the peace. States should rely as much as is possible on proactively resolving disputes, on maintaining interdependence, but on a mutual and equitable basis that resists <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/44/1/42/12237/Weaponized-Interdependence-How-Global-Economic">weaponization</a>. Deterrence is always necessary, but never sufficient.</p>
    <p>It is not our turn to take up the fight against fascism and authoritarianism that our grandfathers and great grandfathers won before us. What is ours is to learn the lesson of both the great wars and all the smaller ones, that our first and most important work is to prevent from ever emerging the poisonous choice between capitulation or conflict. Fascism and authoritarianism are defeated by the example and experience of prosperous liberality, which war extinguishes, sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently.</p>
    <p>Peace alone is insufficient to prevent fascism, as our recent experience attests. But war is always fascism’s friend. Civilization is a narrower road than barbarism. Neither of the simple choices, ferocity or passivity, can sustain it. Civilization, like life itself, requires continual attention, adaptation, innovation, improvisation. It’s exhausting work, Sisyphean, thankless. It is so much easier, so much more exhilarating, to relax ones grip and let slip the dogs. Death is easier than life.</p>

    <p>I’ve written about this <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5117.html">before</a>, but I wondered if I couldn’t be concise.</p>
    <p>Umm. Oh well.</p>
    <p>Price rationing of scarce goods has three important characteristics:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>When the supply of goods is price elastic, price rationing — allocating initially scarce supply to the highest bidders — provokes new production of goods, helping relieve the scarcity to the benefit of all.</li>
     <li><em>Ceteris paribus</em>, all else being equal, price rationing allocates scarce goods to the people who value them most.</li>
     <li>Under circumstances where purchasing power is unequal, price rationing allocates goods to the people with more purchasing power in preference to people with less.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The first two characteristics are generally desirable. They are the reasons economists have historically favored price rationing, and are good reasons why we all should favor price rationing under some circumstances.</p>
    <p>However, from a welfare perspective, Characteristic #3 is a point <em>against</em> price rationing. Suppose we had a limited supply of food, enough to feed the whole population, but not enough to give everyone a nice dessert. Under conditions of stark inequality and pure, self-interested, price rationing, the wealthy would enjoy their desserts and the poor would starve. Under nearly anyone's social welfare functions (just a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5486.html">fancy way of saying</a> their values), the dessert-plus-starvation result is inferior to the everybody-eats outcome. So, in this case, it's better to choose equal allocation rather than price-rationing to decide who gets what.</p>
    <p>Characteristic #1 is a powerful argument in favor of price rationing. But it also is dependent upon circumstances. In general, when industries are competitive, supply tends to be price elastic, because producers fear that if they raise prices very much, competitors capable of expanding production will undercut us and gain market share at our expense.</p>
    <p>But under monopoly, supply tends to be price <em>inelastic</em>. From a producer’s perspective, the very sweetest outcome is when you can get more profit by simply raising prices, without incurring the costs and hassles of new production. (Hat tip <a href="https://wealtheconomics.substack.com/">Steve Roth</a>!) Further, price elasticity requires that suppliers produce inefficiently, in a static and narrow sense. Firms have to invest in capacity that under current price and demand conditions will be "slack”. If no new demand materializes, that investment will be wasted.</p>
    <p>So, without the discipline imposed by rivals who threaten to steal market share, monopolies tend to optimize for current or narrowly foreseeable market conditions. While they may be unprepared for them, they are very glad to be surprised by positive demand shocks. Sure, they will be unable to actually <em>meet</em> that demand at current prices. But they will enjoy the jump in prices by which they ration the insufficient level of production they are prepared to manage.</p>
    <p>I’ve written in terms of “monopoly”, but the same argument holds for highly consolidated industries. Firms tacitly coordinate on highly optimized, “zero slack” supply chains, secure in the knowledge that if there is a positive demand shock, neither they nor their rivals will have the capacity to quickly expand share and eat one another’s lunch. Quantity produced will fail to expand. Instead, they will all enjoy an increase in prices and profits.</p>
    <p>So.</p>
    <p>Characteristics 1 and 2 above are really great arguments for price rationing! But Characteristic 3 is an argument against price rationing. Whether price rationing is desirable depends how much the downside of Characteristic 3 weighs against the upside of Characteristics 1 and 2. The case for price rationing depends, quite simply, on how materially equal a society we are, in terms of the dollar value of purchasing power we can each sustain. The more equal we are, the stronger the case for price rationing.</p>
    <p>Plus, Characteristic 1, the most persuasive argument for price rationing, depends upon market structure, on how competitive and contestable our industries in actual fact are. When our economy is one in which most industries are competitive, the case for price rationing is very strong, as we can expect that when demand grows suddenly strong, quantity will expand to meet everyone’s needs, and prices will rise not so much. When industries are consolidated and supply chains are “optimized”, we can expect demand shocks to translate into price shocks, exacerbating the social cost of inequality.</p>
    <p>We can’t rely on any dogma. We have to actually evaluate these tradeoffs. The social cost of letting designer handbags be priced so only the wealthy can afford them is small, so designer handbags can pretty much always be price-rationed. The social cost of disparate allocation of food, water, or housing can be tremendous, if we do not have a clear abundance of those resources on the market. For these goods, the choice of price-rationing versus regulated allocation can’t be made theoretically and <em>a priori.</em> Perhaps these goods should be price-rationed, but only if you can show that in fact prices won't rise so much, because new supply will be mobilized to overwhelm the potentially serious cost of disparate allocation.</p>
    <p>Price rationing has another advantage. It’s the allocative procedure that, in our current society, we consider normal, even “<a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/no-choice-but-freedom/">natural</a>”. When we interject other allocative schemes, there’s inevitably a political struggle over whether and exactly what should be imposed. That struggle can be socially costly. Real resources will be squandered on zero-sum litigation and lobbying. More insidiously, whatever the outcome, those who fail to get their way perceive their loss as injustice, unnecessarily and artificially imposed by state actors never free of corrupt influence.</p>
    <p>By camouflaging divisive outcomes as neutral results of "natural" market forces, price rationing helps conserve the legitimacy of state and society. I think that's a huge virtue. We'd be better off if we lived in circumstances where we could dogmatically stick with price rationing and it would work well enough.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately we do not. That would require and society more materially equal and an economy more pervasively competitive than what we have in fact allowed to befall us.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This one is dedicated to my friend <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cshentrup/111257141030214753">Clay Shentrup</a>, who I suspect will disagree with every word.</p>

      <title>The rhetoric of condemnation</title>

    <p>I find myself increasingly frustrated with the rhetoric of condemnation. In particular, I find the way people use “war crimes” and “genocide” to be lazy and evasive of the actual questions that need to be answered in order to address the situations that provoke those accusations.</p>
    <p>To be very clear, I am not to in any way exonerating, defending, minimizing the many atrocities that attract those labels. They are reprehensible actions that anyone ought to find abhorrent. But those atrocities occur in the context of histories and unfolding events for which “just don’t do that” is nowhere near a sufficient answer. Speakers often use the accusations to place themselves on the side of virtue and the accused on the side of evil, without owning up to the consequences they would require of those they admonish.</p>
    <p>Whatever some treaty or document held up as “international law” does or does not say about the matter is immaterial. Situations actually need to be addressed, and “international law” as it stands is far from being a system to which states or nonstate actors could simply agree to conform and then expect that their rights and vital interests will be protected.</p>
    <p>There are disputes. They have to be addressed with solutions that antagonists can be persuaded at least to live with. Until such solutions are found, there will be conflict. When the terms of conflict create conditions in which the alternative to war crimes is unacceptable to any or all the parties, then war crimes will be committed.</p>
    <p>Both the Palestinians and the Israel provide rich examples. The intentional slaughter of 1300 civilians for dancing one morning or waking up in their homes is obviously a war crime, regardless of any right to resist occupiers or claims that their presence on the territory is illegitimate. However routine it has become, every time Hamas launches a missile from Gaza towards Tel Aviv or some Israeli town, they are committing a war crime. Hamas does not carefully target its rockets toward military objectives in a manner calculated to ensure that any civilian "collateral damage" would be proportionate (whatever all that slippery language is supposed to mean). Yet given the actual balance of power and armaments available, if even the desultory missile barrages are taken off the table, Hamas would have no plausible means to prosecute their cause other than on terms set entirely by the Israelis. Symmetric military-to-military warfare against Israel, waged from bases segregated from Gaza’s civilians, would lead to a quick extermination of Hamas' soldiers. It would, very mercifully, spare civilians on both sides, but it would do nothing for the Palestinian cause.</p>
    <p>Hamas should not slaughter and kidnap civilians. If you are not still reeling from the horror of what happened last Saturday, I am. Hamas should not even lob missiles at towns, whether or not the “Iron Dome” will manage to intercept them. But if all we do is condemn the war crimes, then we are saying morality compels the Palestinians to accept complete and total impotence to prosecute what they believe is a just and urgent cause. So of course they choose to commit war crimes.</p>
    <p>It is absolutely a war crime for Israel to cut off food, water, and power from the civilians of Gaza. But if we accept as given that Israel must extirpate Hamas as a military force from Gaza, then the logistics that support those who will fight and kill Israeli soldiers are the same logistics that support the civilian population. A ground invasion of a densely built urban landscape deeply familiar to its defenders will cost the lives of many Israeli soldiers no matter what. But fewer Israelis will die if the force they fight is depleted and exhausted before the battle begins. When you are at war, ours versus theirs is a more salient concern than civilian versus soldier. The outcome and toll of war is largely a function of logistics. In this case, Israel controls the logistics of the opposing force. To refrain from war crime, it would have to literally feed the snipers who will await its soldiers. Unsurprisingly, Israel chooses the war crime.</p>
    <p>Depending on where the balance of your sympathies lie, it is easy — and it is accurate! — to highlight the criminality of either side. If your view is that, however regrettable, the <em>status quo ante</em> plight of the Palestinians was in some sense acceptable or tolerable or redressable by better means, then it is easy to condemn them for war crimes. If your view is that Israel could and should simply cease its occupation, whatever exactly that would mean in practice, then you can just condemn the settler state’s crimes and demand that it accede to a Palestine “free, from the river to the sea”.</p>
    <p>But if you think either of these things, you are a fool. Most people are not so foolish, and understand that the Palestinians have been in a cruel, impossible, and unjust position for decades, and also that if Israel were to simply relinquish its authority and lay down arms, civil war and bloodbath would be immediate. It doesn’t matter which side you accuse of war crimes, even if you are right. Of course you are right. But you are helping nothing but the cause of your own self-righteousness. Or worse, you are helping one side gird itself for and justify new atrocities against the other.</p>
    <p>If you want to do some good, you have to actually help unravel the thorny circumstances under which each side understandably views the commission of war crimes as superior to the alternative, despite all of our righteous condemnation. Israel should have a government that offers real hope of progress for the Palestinians, rather than one that buys the support of fascists by continually dispossessing Palestinian residents of the West Bank, and buys the support of many others by promising safety while keeping the dispossessed out-of-sight and out-of-mind like factory-farmed poultry. The Palestinians should have governments that are meaningfully accountable to their publics, with legally enshrined regular elections, rather than one mafia that finds patrons for its terrorism and another mafia that finds patrons by collaborating.</p>
    <p>I have no tablets with solutions to bring down from Mt. Sinai. I do have suggestions. Israel should not invade Gaza at all, after all, but should offer clear conditions for the kind of government to which it would cede sovereign control of Gaza’s borders, and define milestones that would define incremental progress toward that goal. Obviously one of those milestones would be complete exclusion of Hamas’ current leadership. Israelis who do not wish their country’s role in the world to be fuse of the apocalypse should replace the Netanyahu catastrophe quickly. A new government should commit to naturalize and enfranchise willing Palestinian residents of the West Bank. Settlement has succeeded at changing the facts on the ground, so creating a Palestinian state there would be very challenging. Letting Gaza become a Palestinian state while integrating the West Bank allows Israel to be what most Israelis want, simultaneously a Jewish state and a liberal democracy. Palestinians who prefer their own state could look forward to and help to build a well-governed city-state in Gaza. Jewish Israelis who fear differential birthrates might soon overwhelm them should work to integrate and grant opportunities to Palestinians so that they too experience a demographic transition. Regardless of how a demographic horserace works out, integration does the most important work. Just in case, it might be wise to better entrench protection of minority rights into the structure of the Israeli state.</p>
    <p>Perhaps all of this is hopelessly naive. I look forward to your counterproposals. Naivety at least is more constructive than uselessly self-righteous condemnations of war crimes.</p>

    <p>“The Jews” do not have a right to national self-determination. “The Palestinians” do not have a right to national self-determination. Neither “Ukrainians” nor “Russians” nor “Estonians” nor “Chinese” have a right to national self-determination. There is no group or tribe called "the Americans" who have a right of national self-determination. There was no such thing as “the Germans” when Bismarck began to unite the state that is now Germany, which is not Austria or Denmark or Switzerland or Holland despite historical and ethnolinguistic entanglements.</p>
    <p>“National self-determination” is a stupid, vicious, pernicious idea. It should be counted among the most destructive ideas in all of human history. The conceit that there are <em>a priori</em> nations to which some set of rights and dignities must inhere even at the cost of violent struggle pits human against human in the name of fabricated, ever shifting flags. However powerfully our emotions may become mixed up with these identities, they merit no moral deference. People engage in violence on behalf of sports teams. Their passions may be deep and sincere. But those United for Manchester have no right of self determination that justifies defiance of the laws of their state.</p>
    <p>Nation is a flame that burns hot and fickle. It offers no foundation upon which to build a humane and peaceful world. Modernity is not built of or on behalf of nations. Modernity is built upon sovereign <em>states</em>.</p>
    <p>States are constructed from boundaries that are at best arbitrary. There is no justice in the armistice lines of whatever ancient squabble defined the border of your state. There is no justice in lines drawn on behalf of colonizers by Sykes and Picot. But what is important is that there are lines.</p>
    <p>The lines may be, they always are, wrong in some important sense. At a given moment, they may not match linguistic or perceived ethnic communities. They may have resulted from unjust conquest. But once they are mutually recognized, once states emerge that, however resentfully, accept this side of the line is ours, that side of the line is yours, then and only then is any kind of peace possible.</p>
    <p>These lines divide, but they also join. We make them solid and they make us solid in much the same way as marriages. A much larger community than the states that coadjoin recognizes the lines, and promises to uphold them, to shame or shun or even to attack any party that should violate them. Like the topography of marriages in a medieval village, borders are simultaneously pure fictions and the solid foundation of communal life. They cannot be sundered unilaterally, and should not be redrawn lightly, but only with mutual accord of the parties most affected.</p>
    <p>History offers ample evidence that deference to borders, however arbitrary and illegitimate their provenance, is far superior to rekindling conflict about where they should be drawn. States with stable borders, even borders unfavoraby drawn against their will, can live in peace and prosper. (Consider Singapore.) When borders are uncertain and violently contested, only the devil prospers.</p>
    <p>States precede nations. That’s not a descriptive claim. Of course before the emergence of any given state, there would have been groups sharing language, customs, sentimental bonds. But there is neither peace nor permanence in stateless tribes. If you must call them nations, then they are the worst kind of nations.</p>
    <p><em>E pluribus unum</em> is the work of every state. If you think a state has succeeded because it is “homogeneous”, you've got cause and effect backward. The condition of humankind without organized states is tribal. When observed over time and at scale, you find not stable homogeneity but continual fluidity, as conquests and massacres and migrations and alliances and the simple lack of authoritative dictionaries mean everything from religion to race to language shift, diverge, and remix. For a state to survive and thrive it must, within whatever borders emerge, forge a nation that will sustain the state, and <em>vice versa</em>. The French were never a nation until a series of events, over time and sometimes quite violently, created France as a shared polity to which its subjects owe deference, within which they accept a shared identity. States build nations much more than they emerge from them.</p>
    <p>Nation-building is a continual process. The forces that render nations fickle and often violent in the absence of states continue in their presence. People continue to migrate. Citizens embrace multiple identities, some of which are shared across borders, others of which might fragment the polity. Ideas and new identities continually emerge. They vie for adoption, and become new bases for cooperation and competition that may threaten to destabilize the state.</p>
    <p>Successful states work continually, assimilating, accommodating, and excluding (in the framework of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/politics-of-nationbuilding/C9E4A27E97D35705F0549C0FC1C03457">Harris Mylonas</a>), inventing and reinventing the nation in order to sustain conditions of <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/31/state-as-coordination/index.html">effective coordination at scale</a>. Traditions that might seem stable reflect continual reinvigoration, not mere passive inheritance. What is new and changing might represent decay, or else innovation and adaptation. We can only tell the difference <em>ex post</em>, when the nation coheres and the state functions, or not.</p>
    <p>Even when borders hold and are not meaningfully contested, states can fail. A state is not only a territory, but a territory within which a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence">monopoly of legitimate violence</a> obtains. What does that even mean? In any state there is freelance violence. There is nowhere without crime. What renders violence "legitimate”?</p>
    <p>Legitimacy sounds very subjective, almost populist. Is a state “legitimate” because the masses agree with it, because people like it? No. It’s nice when they do, maybe even helpful, but nice isn’t what we’re after.</p>
    <p>We measure the legitimacy of a state by whether those on its territory both conform to it and resort to it. When the state commands, in the civilized tone of some legal notice (the threat of violence echoing faintly from the pages), do citizens obey? Or do various factions succeed at resisting, ignoring, and defying its edicts? When residents enter into dispute, do they draw their own weapons, or make use of the state’s courts and legislatures and police? Legitimacy is revealed by how people behave, not by what they say they think.</p>
    <p>My country, the United States, remains for now not a failed state, despite emerging tribalisms which do threaten it if they are not addressed. There is crime, but it is idiosyncratic and freelance, or else small scale (like urban gangs). There may be neighborhoods where the state’s monopoly on legitimate violence is challenged, where people with gripes turn to kingpin rather than cop to resolve disputes, where locally organized violence compels disobedience of the state’s law. But overall, for now, there is a unified state, to whose edicts the vast majority however willingly or reluctantly conform, whose offices are called upon to resolve disputes in place of local violence.</p>
    <p>Despite Israel's remarkable successes, the territory Israel/Palestine constitutes a failed state. There is no single government to whose edicts residents conform, to whose offices residents resort to resolve their deep and serious disputes. The failure should not be understood as the result of conflicts between two nations’ legitimate aspiration for self-determination. That is a poisonous framing. “Nations” unanchored to states always make claims that conflict profoundly with one another. Kurds and Uigurs and LGBT people and Turks and White Separatists and Pan-Africans and Jews and Christians and Arabs and Han and Hindu all make claims that would profoundly contravene the aspirations and asserted rights of one another. Even where nations <em>are</em> anchored by states, insulated by territorial isolation and civilized by formal governance, contesting claims emerge that threaten conflict and violence, internally and internationally. Wise states work to manage those conflicts. "Stateless nations" should be integrated, not be treated independently as objects of deference.</p>
    <p>The territorial boundaries of combined Israel/Palestine are not meaningfully contested, thanks to the IDF. Other states meddle (hi Iran), but they do not invade. What remains is for a state to emerge on the territory that commands near universal legitimacy. Instead, egged on by foreign football fans masquerading as coreligionists or comrades, factions have worked to harden and heighten conflicts between pre-state conceptions of nationhood, rather than to forge a state that could superintend a shared future.</p>
    <p>I’m not trying to argue that uniting in a multiconfessional liberal democracy is the near-term solution for Israel/Palestine. That would be my preference, but given the actual passions of the communities who occupy the territory, it may not realistic any time soon. Maybe if the territory were cleaved into two (or <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/a-three-state-solution-is-the-only">three</a>), successful states could more easily emerge on parts of it, with clear new borders that could be internationally enforced. I'm skeptical there too. I don’t have some brilliant solution.</p>
    <p>But we can start by not pouring fuel on the fire. The Jews of Israel have no right to national self determination, any more than the Kurds of Turkey and Iraq and Iran do. (If you think the Kurds do have that right, if you are eager to fan the flames of violent decolonization there too, I have nothing to offer you but disapproval, despite my tremendous admiration for the Kurds.) The Palestinians have no right to national self-determination, not because they are somehow a fake nation (every nation is), but because that’s a stupid, incoherent, and destructive principle.</p>
    <p>There are human beings. There is a territory. The humans could find civilized means of coexisting. Without an effective state, no one has any right to anything except death, sooner or later. The rest of us should stop fanning any party’s stupid self righteousness and do whatever we can to help them all choose later, much much later.</p>

    <p>Ye olde “economic anxiety” versus racism debate is back on, God help us. Here is <a href="https://theworkbench.jeffspross.com/p/if-trump-voters-dont-care-about-their">Jeff Spross</a> and, er, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/opinion/trump-meritocracy-educated.html">David Brooks</a> making the case that Trumpism / right populism / resurgent fascism have something to do with reaction to legitimate grievances of an economy increasingly stratified into communities of winners and the “left behind”. Here is <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/4/23818817/trump-support-david-brooks-economic-anxiety">Zack Beauchamp</a> reprising the great <a href="https://www.vox.com/">vox.com</a> tradition of pointing out that if you look at fine-grained patterns of who goes <a href="https://www.kkoworld.com/kitablar/ejen-ionesko-kergedan-eng.pdf">rhino</a>, you don’t see that it’s the poor and downtrodden, you find that it’s the fucking racists.</p>
    <p>If I have to pick sides, I’m on the side of Spross and, er, Brooks. I’ve <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6632.html">written</a> about why the individual characteristics of Trump supporters shouldn’t eclipse the characteristics of the communities from which that support disproportionately derives. I <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6602.html">endorse</a> Spross’ position that we should consider the implications of the stories that we choose.</p>
    <p>Social affairs are not like natural sciences where usually (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality">not always</a>) one way of modeling the world is plainly “best” and we should work from that story, discarding all the rest. Navigating social affairs requires developing a collection of different, often conflicting, accounts of how things work and making wise decisions about which accounts to use in different contexts and for different purposes. It is not only legitimate, but morally necessary, to consider the implications of different accounts before choosing which one you will let guide your actions. When policymakers accept “hard truths that can’t be denied” (in modern parlance, we might hear “the science can’t be denied”), we face a risk they might persuade themselves to do something awful.</p>
    <p>It’s hubris to imagine there is any science so reliable in social affairs, and it is sin to allow any collection of (now) studies or (then) political theories, to justify exclusion, elimination, disenfranchisement, collective punishment or penury in the name of your certainty in some greater good. If you would neither scruple to let your “hard truths” frame some hard action, nor derive any kind of moral and constructive action from your theory, what good to anyone is your “science”? The rational choice is to draw from our portfolio of understandings multiple but actionable truths — the best we can come up with, but subject to a usefulness constraint — and then apply them constructively.</p>
    <p>In this old debate, “economic anxiety” versus racism, the mistake is to choose sides at all. As is usually the case in social affairs, the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. It is an intellectual error, then, to design studies as “horse races” to decide which is the better explanation. Perhaps there is no evidence at all for one hypothesis, in which case, sure, it should be rejected. But there is plenty of evidence, especially at the community level, for the “economic anxiety” hypothesis, and plenty of evidence, especially at the individual-characteristics level, for the “racial resentment” (racist motherfuckers) hypothesis. It is an error to imagine that “drilling down” to a more fine-grained level inherently provides superior or more actionable information. Biology provides insights that chemistry cannot. No one could produce a working pharmaceutical from the very best human understanding of quarks.</p>
    <p>When in social affairs we have evidence for multiple, nonexclusive hypotheses, the wise thing to do is not to snipe over which we should reject and which we should accept, but to explore how they might relate to one another, and when it is best to deploy one understanding or the other as a simplification.</p>
    <p>For this particular debate, the model I would encourage you to think about is triage. For most of us today, triage is just the name they give to intake at the ER. But in wartime, it refers to the harsher practice of deciding whom to treat and whom to let die. When medical resources are scarce, you make decisions about who won’t make it anyway. You take care not to waste medicine that might save someone else’s life on people you’ve decided will die regardless.</p>
    <p>When resources are abundant, we avoid making these kinds of choices. We treat everybody. Some small fraction of the people with long odds become miracles, and we let those be worth the cost. When resources are abundant, health care is a human right. But when resources are scarce, we cull the herd, kill the runts or at least leave them to die.</p>
    <p>Fascism is a process of internal exclusion, quite analogous to triage, although more in anger than in sadness. At a material level, a fascist order divides the polity into the worthy volk and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_unworthy_of_life">life unworthy of life</a>”. It promises to reward and protect the former while extracting whatever labor can be squozen from the latter in the process of its exclusion or extermination.</p>
    <p>This is not how human communities behave when they are secure and prosperous, when generosity, magnanimity, “civilization”, are broadly understood to be affordable public virtues. Polities “triage” the worthy from the unworthy under circumstances of perceived scarcity, of perceived threat. When happily ever after for everybody is a luxury we cannot afford. If some of us are to thrive, others must be sacrificed.</p>
    <p>With medical triage it may (or may not) be sufficient for a few professionals to coldly decide, on the basis of medical facts, that <em>these</em> patients are a bad use of resources, while <em>those</em> patients may be helped by treatment. But humans writ large don’t work this way. We <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/998.html">require</a> <em>moral</em> heuristics to guide our actions, to motivate and then justify what we do. If at a communal level we are going to starve or enslave or expel or exterminate some group, it will not be enough, for most people, to say what a shame, but it is necessary. Instead we will find reasons why they <em>deserve</em> it. We will discover why they are in fact a danger whose dispossession is not to be lamented, but celebrated.</p>
    <p>The identification of insidious internal enemies, deliverance from whom demands that “patriotic”, “real” citizens submit to military-like coordination and obedience, is the <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html">core move of fascism</a>. It begins with the perception <em>we can no longer afford.</em> To which political entrepreneurs then append <em>to tolerate these people</em> as the concretization of what we cannot afford. It begins with the communal analog of a "<a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-scarcity-mentality">scarcity mindset</a>”.</p>
    <p>With this account, we can reconcile the conflicting evidence about economic anxiety and cultural resentment. At the communal level, economic factors predict which places are likely to become susceptible to a fascist dynamic, because the case for dividing and culling begins with a perception of scarcity. Communities don’t triage when resources are widely perceived to be abundant and secure.</p>
    <p>But at an individual level, within distressed communities, the people most enthusiastic to participate in the fascist dynamic are not likely to be the weak and dispossessed (who after all, might be susceptible to culling, depending what internal enemy gets identified) but those who feel safe in their own position and have preexisting resentments against candidate enemies. The political dynamic can’t successfully take hold, has no fertile habitat, without the “economic anxiety”. The members of the community who most enthusiastically participate in the thrill of fascism are not primarily the downtrodden, however, but relatively safe people who perceive an opportunity long denied to give effect to resentments they stewed in privately when prosperity and security bred norms of magnanimity and tolerance in their communities.</p>
    <p>The good news in this story is that both factions of the “economic anxiety” vs racism debate get to keep their preferred prescriptions for discouraging fascism. If a sense of secure prosperity can be delivered and sustained among the broad public, then fascism will find little soil to plant seeds. If “racial resentment” — or, more generally, the psychological and cultural antecedents to the inimicalization of minorities — can be reduced, then the polity would be more resistant to fascism even during periods of economic stress and anxiety. The debate over what kind of politics to adopt, over the praxis of prophylaxis, becomes a question of which is more plausible and desirable to achieve via political means: building a society in which the bulk of the public perceives itself as prosperous and safe in that prosperity, or reforming the culture so that prejudices and resentments towards subgroups are diminished to insignificance.</p>
    <p>My view is that the shape of the material world is more susceptible than culture to political means, and that material reforms to engender a broader and more secure prosperity for most of the public are urgently desirable — to discourage the emergence of fascism, but also on their own terms. So in practice I seem to fall on the “economic anxiety” side of the debate. Antifascists more attached to the economic <em>status quo</em> or more skeptical of economic antecedents prefer a politics that intervenes on the cultural side, focusing on countering fascist organizations, fighting and shaming prominent white supremacists, and trying to develop antiracist culture and education.</p>
    <p>I am skeptical of the suitability of politics to address cultural concerns directly. I think that over time, politics affects culture profoundly, but indirectly, by altering the shape of material constraints and incentives under which cultures form and transform. I think when politics too overtly tries to alter culture, it yields backlash, becomes resisted as indoctrination or “reeducation” in conflict with the basic tenets of a free and equal society.</p>
    <p>A free and equal society, like all societies, requires that its public think and understand the world in ways conducive to the <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/31/state-as-coordination/index.html">effective coordination at scale</a> that prosperity and defense require. But a free and equal society does not have the luxury of overtly coercing its public to think as they are told. A free and equal society must <em>persuade</em> its public — with speech that individuals are genuinely free to reject, with carrots for prosocial behavior rather than punishments for dissenters — to develop ways of thinking under which people voluntarily, “naturally”, act in ways and within bounds consistent with the functioning of the polity.</p>
    <p>A free and equal society is a harder thing to govern and to keep than a more authoritarian system which can impose ideology, culture, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6970.html">authority</a>, hierarchy by force. But an effective free and equal society is a much better community for a human being to be a part of. I do hope we will find the patience and light-touch cleverness to improve or build or rebuild a free and equal society rather than revert, under fascism or in the name of antifascism, to more mechanistic forms of social control that, as information technology has developed, become more available and so more tempting to leaders under inevitable conditions of crisis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/atensnut/status/1684954852063862784">If I were the plutocracy</a>, I’d do everything I could do to discredit the one institution that I only mostly — but don’t quite fully — control that might be capable of harming me. I’d refer to the imperfectly democratic government as “the deep state”, and imply that the worst of the many, many things the state does precisely on my behalf are in fact the work of a secretive cadre embedded among the dedicated civil servants who are a constant annoyance and threat to me, despite my continual and mostly effective work to buy them off, or else neutralize them by owning their more ambitious and venal superiors. I’d call garish attention to the results of my own corruption of the state, but attribute it to the state itself, in order to misdirect attention from me and to discredit any possibility of muscular state action, the one thing that might actually diminish me.</p>
    <p>If I were the plutocracy, I’d do everything I could to distract the public from issues like economic consolidation, strong enforcement of ever expanding property rights, weak enforcement of dwindling labor protections, universalist social democracy, progressive taxation. I'd make sure that the people I hire people at the media I own all understand that stuff like taxes and patents and insurance is and must always be boring to the general public, whose interests need more color than the mere dollars and cents they live and mostly die by. I would encourage a very lively public sphere — no, lively isn’t the word — I’d encourage a public sphere into which nearly everyone cannot help but be drawn, whether by salacious curiosity or profound sense of injustice or by very real, very personal, threat. I’d hire the best storytellers, the most skilled manipulators of the human lizard brain, to promote a truly engaged citizenry. I would ensure a citizenry perpetually, exhaustingly, actively, engaged — in all of the controversies that do not threaten me.</p>
    <p>If I were the plutocracy, I’d scapegoat immigrants, racial minorities, and sexual minorities in order to give the public someone to blame for the metastatizing pathology that results from all the material security I am sucking and sucking from them. Then I’d lavishly fund advocates of immigrants, racial minorities, and sexual minorities — the more radical, the weirder, the more aggressive, the better — to ensure a constant parade of controversies and outrages that activate people’s deep sense of identity and threat and injustice, so that they argue with one other — they might even riot and kill one another — over anything and everything but me.</p>
    <p>If I were the plutocracy, the public would always know me to be there for them. I would be on their side in all these fights, since I would be effusively financing all the sides. Some of my organs would fund racial justice, while others would be donors to “antiwoke”, while others would ensure nicely catered luncheons for “Moms for Liberty”, and others would build underground railroads for people seeking gender-affirming care. Almost all of my organs would be deeply sincere about what they do. Meet them, you will love how genuine they are! Yet while they seem to be battling against one another, in a deeper sense they all — we all — would be pulling together in perfect harmony towards a common purpose, maintaining and expanding our extraordinary wealth and control that — surely you agree! — must be the basis for any notion of progress and civilized society, even if it does impose some unfortunate but necessary burdens on the rest of you who must serve us.</p>

    <p>There's a <a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/">certain kind of dour leftist</a> that always goes on about "degrowth".</p>
    <p>Growth has been the lodestar and definition of virtue to generations of economists. Robert Lucas famously quipped, once you start thinking about it you can't think of anything else.</p>
    <p>But to "degrowthers", economic growth is not merely undesirable, It is a profound evil. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21664-growth-for-the-sake-of-growth-is-the-ideology-of">"Growth for the sake of growth's is the ideology of the cancer cell"</a>. In a monstrous capitalist system that produces absurd and wasteful bounties for some while delivering cruelty and scarcity to most, fetishization of growth becomes license to do ever more of the same, even while pushing planetary ecosystems beyond capacity, into a collapse that will destroy us all.</p>
    <p>Economics is sometimes described as the dismal science, but in fact its dominant mainstream is characterized by a chirpy whiggishness. The supercilious voice that narrates <em>The Economist</em> magazine is not just telling you that unfettered "free markets" and a light-touch state are the way to go. It is also cheerfully instructing that if we do set markets free, we will all be delivered to an ever more brilliant, prosperous, happy future.</p>
    <p>You see this chirpy whiggishness in the degrowthers' online nemeses, Max Roser and his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272929/global-poverty-health-crime-literacy-good-news">happy data charts</a>, Steven Pinker and his <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/the-dangers-of-worrying-about-doomsday/article38062215/">pink</a> Steven-Pinkerish-ness. Let's keep going as we have been going, we are growing, getting richer, making everything better for everyone along the way. Radical changes that aim to improve things for the have-nots by imposing constraints on the have-too-muches, rather than just growing the pie, will destroy the goose that is slowly but consistently delivering ever more golden eggs to everybody. If it doesn't feel that way to you, well, your pain is misinformation. Follow the science, look at the data, find a psychiatrist.</p>
    <p>Of course, climate change and the ever more pressing possibility of ecological collapse is a real fly in the whiggish ointment. The follow-the-science crowd does not dispute that if historical correlations between say, fossil-fuel use and GDP growth continue, the planet would boil more spectacularly than an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hsyWKYBvH7c">egg in the microwave</a>.</p>
    <p>But, they point out, the <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-intensity-of-gdp-1990-2021">fossil-fuel intensity of GDP</a> is declining, and thanks to growth (with which they conflate, contestably, with technology), we'll soon be able to replace fossil fuels with clean electricity even while the economy continues an exponential trend.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, if by some miracle we succeed at conquering carbon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-10-05/economists-are-blind-to-the-limits-of-growth">waste heat from even clean energy sources</a> would start to boil us in a century or so, unless we radically reduce the total <em>energy</em> intensity of growth, or else deploy very risky forms of geoengineering. And it's not just energy and global warming. Economic growth is correlated with raw material extraction, deforestation, industrial pollution, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-microplastic-crisis-is-getting-exponentially-worse/">microplastics</a> and <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/great-pacific-garbage-patch/">megalittering</a>. We'd have to reduce the GDP intensity of all of these impacts at a pace that exceeds economic growth in order to maintain a survivable planet.</p>
    <p><em>Of course!</em> say the whigs. <em>Let's do these things!</em></p>
    <p>Degrowth is immoral, it is short-circuiting the engine of humanity's collective prosperity. But <em>dematerialization</em>, well, dematerialization is great! It is just the application of human ingenuity to produce more <em>value</em> with less physical stuff and energy.</p>
    <p>The whigs point out, correctly, that value is not a physical commodity, subject to physical laws or limits. Value is an incorporeal construct, its measures invented by economic statisticians to capture putative behavioral correlates — primarily willingess to pay incorporeal units which themselves are available without physical limit, constrained only by judgments made by elaborate technocracies about the "real" value of those units to a hypothetical species of utilty maximizer.</p>
    <p>The laws of physics need not apply!</p>
    <p>Okay. But let's get real. But what would this actually look like?</p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, I think I got my first glimpse. It looks like <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">this</a>.</p>
    <p>Until recently, virtual reality (like artificial intelligence) has been a joke, a transformational technology perpetually a decade away from transforming anything. But Apple's preternatural knack is to take technologies that already exist but are marginal, mere toys for hobbyists, and turn them into products so ubiquitous they upend society. Its one-two punch of the <span style="word-spacing: -0.5ch;">Apple <span style="letter-spacing: -2pt; font-size: 90%;">][</span></span> then Macintosh gave us modern computing. A variety of tablets and mp3 players preceded Apple's blockbuster versions. Laptops and mobile phones were already far from marginal. But when Apple put all these pieces together in the form of the iPhone, the world changed so radically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-jean-twenge.html">we now have no idea how to raise our children</a>.</p>
    <p>What if it turns out that "mobile" was mere dress rehearsal, and the main event will be virtual reality for the rest of us? Smartphones have already delivered dematerialization. Kids aren't breathless for their drivers' licenses at age 16 <a href="https://theweek.com/travel/1020987/why-us-teens-arent-getting-their-drivers-licenses">anymore</a>. They don't want rides back and forth to live out a decade as mallrats. They do a lot of socializing that might otherwise have involved fuel consumption, cosmetics, fast-fashion, condoms, day-after pills, and abortions over their phones now. That's dematerialization!</p>
    <p>As they grow up, an increasing share of them may join a "laptop class" in one form or another, delivering whatever services it is they sell over wires, driving nowhere to do so.</p>
    <p>So far this has all been a bit unsatisfying, a kind of Tofurkey-substitute for the real meat of face-to-face socialization and collaboration. The kids have dematerialized but they are fucking depressed about it. We've dematerialized meetings to Zoom and Microsoft Teams, but how do we do <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/remote-work-is-bad-news-for-junior-workers-especially-women/">mentoring</a> without relationships that form parsimoniously in the hallways and might be nourished over a drink after work?</p>
    <p>But virtual life is also in some respects better than the real thing. In its heyday we hung out on Twitter not because we couldn't have a real social life, but because most of us couldn't possibly have conversations within our physically-accessible circles as lively and well-informed and potentially <em>relevant</em> as the exchanges that we could join online. Like the kids, we grew depressed, because there are things we get from face-to-face sociability that no amount of shared interest or extraordinary knowledge or accessible status hierarchy could make up for. But for what we were losing, we weren't just getting a shadow of the real thing. We were getting something new, something better than what had ever been available to us before. It's just there were some hard tradeoffs we had to make.</p>
    <p>What if that ceased to be the case? What if virtual copresence, in the form of goggle-free avatars whose form and expressivity are reconstructed and enhanced from our goggled faces by uncanny artificial intelligences, proves to be better than the real thing? What if we augment ever cleverer, ever lighter, dematerializing goggles with body suits that allow (consistent with user-defined, algorithmically gatekept <em>safety</em>) even for warmth and touch?</p>
    <p>This would be <em>The Matrix</em>, except emerging "voluntarily".</p>
    <p>We need those scare quotes. Acquiescing to technological change is never voluntary, exactly, at an individual level. If this is the way the world goes, you don't really have a choice but to join it. It becomes voluntary like driving was voluntary once jobs and residences became so far dispersed you could only access both with a car. But, like that evolution of the mid-to-late 20th Century, this brave new world might emerge without much in the way of overt coercion by states. The notion of "collective choice" is always touchy philosophically. It sits in deep tension with conceptions of freedom that center individuals. But it is plausible — and I think the fact of ecological and environmental limits renders it quite likely — that we will collectively choose our own quasi-Matrification. To a large degree, we already have.</p>
    <p>Obviously this could be dystopian. But it might not be. We would not, after all, be literally confined to pods subsisting on liquid nutrient injections. Like kids and dying shopping malls, we would just all become homebodies even more than we have already. Immersed in brilliant <em>virtual</em> outings with friends, in virtual workplaces and virtual romances, large, luxury, housing would just become less important to us. As the resources associated with, say, inefficient exurban living grow more costly — as they have, as they are, as they will likely continue to do — we will simply choose it less. Materially efficient forms of living — think dormatories, or smallish apartments for families — will become less unappealing when we spend much of our time in not-Mark-Zuckerberg's metaverse anyway.</p>
    <p>In any case, as virtuality continues to sap, as it already has sapped, our physical sociability, the business case for dense urban life will grow ever stronger. One reason to live in New York City is because if you want access to cornucopic and obscure commercial niches, if you want both Eritrean and Estonian restaurants and you want exotic musical instrument shops offering theremin lessons, then you need a lot of people tightly knit so that the tiny fraction interested in these obsurities will be enough to support some businesses.</p>
    <p>The same logic works tragically in reverse. The fewer people that share a single tightly knit geography, the more basic and generic the business ecosystem will be. The scale of a "tightly-knit geography" is not just geographical, but it depends upon our behavior, on how far we find it convenient to wander. Holding physical population density constant, as people become less peripatetic in their everyday lives, less dense cities will become less able to support niches that right now we don't consider very obscure.</p>
    <p>Right now, most of us prepurchase mobility across a wide geography by paying high fixed costs for a capital good (a car), and then enjoy low variable costs for physical movement. But as the kids and their cellphones are already showing, in a more virtualized world we'll be content to move about less. So we'll less frequently choose to pay the large fixed cost of a vehicle, and we'll rely upon taxi services like Uber, and maybe occasional car rentals for longer-distance travel. But once we cease prepaying for our transportation with that big vehicle purchase, once the cost of each journey takes the form of a steep variable cost, the expense becomes very salient. We'll rearrange our lives to take those journeys even less.</p>
    <p>The decision not to purchase a car is a lifestyle watershed. The convenience of either the corner store, or Amazon, over big boxes warehouse stores grows hugely. As we drive less, we physically interact across geographies less. The social distance between physical selves grows, unless we <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8772.html">live more densely</a>. We accept smaller homes in order to have nearer neighbors, and a greater variety of corner stores. We replace homes we maintain ourselves with apartment blocks maintained at scale. And we buy a lot less, at least a lot fewer physical goods.</p>
    <p>There will, no doubt, be a huge new array of virtual services to keep "real GDP" growing at some arbitrary economist-prescribed clip. The whigs will always have been right. We'll have grown wealthier and wealthier every year! It's just that, um, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/why-its-harder-for-families-to-thrive">relative prices</a>, will have shifted in ways that make our present <s>standard</s> style of living impossible.</p>
    <p>I suspect we will still want to eat out, to physically meet sometime. We will still want and need to exercise our physical bodies in the real world. We won't have our lawns and leafy streets, so we will want wonderful parks, close to our flats. The gardens some of us will still want to plant will become community gardens, or perhaps green balconies and roof terrances. The family and friends we will still want to physically see, we will want closer by.</p>
    <p>To one of our political tribes, all of this is likely to sound dystopian. To the other, it may come off as more-or-less desirable. There are reasons why Tribe Red — tribe rural and exurban — is in greater denial than Tribe Blue about global warming, climate catastrophe, ecological limits to growth. Tribe Red has much more to pay, much more to lose, in terms of its current values and way of life. The efficiency and environmental case for consolidating humans into dense, efficient urbanity has long been clear. But the humans have values that diverge from and stand above abstract, distant concerns. The wise central planner might long ago have imposed a carbon tax that would compact us into 15-minute cities. But the humans, living lives whose basic contours we want to keep, have resisted.</p>
    <p>Yet Tribe Red kids have been seduced into their phones, just like Tribe Blue kids, if only a bit more slowly. And the next round of kids can look forward to technological worlds far more compelling and seductive than six inch screens that we relegate to our pockets. Even if your job still involves making or moving things in the real world, these virtual worlds are where you'll meet with your boss. They won't be any more optional than the late 20th Century commute was.</p>
    <p>Whether at the end of these seductions are fulfilling brave new lives, or mere shadows of lives left bereft by the loss of unmediated physicality, remains to be seen. In large part, that may be determined by choices we make now, as we build our virtual worlds. Will we build a free, liberal, pluralistic society, or will we all be serfs to Mark Zuckerberg — or Tim Cook — in the metaverse<sup>TM</sup>? That's on us, on all of us.</p>
    <p>But if you are looking for a vision of a future that lets the planet heal from all the damage we've done and are doing, one that citizens of the resource-profligate developed world might be seduced into accepting as market-based "dematerialization", rather than coerced into accepting as "degrowth", that vision is Apple Vision Pro. And then the changes that follow, once the status and relevance of the physical world decline so much, we finally acquiesce to some efficiencies.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>p.s. One might also find an answer to the Fermi paradox in Apple Vision Pro.</p>

     <p><strong>Update:</strong> My friend Chris Peel <a href="https://elk.zone/c.im/@chrisp/110732043439287088">thinks</a> I've been unfair to Max Roser and <em>Our World In Data</em> in characterizing them as whiggish Panglossians. My characterization comes from hazy memories of ancient Twitter fights, in which polarization over the virtue of growth necessarily left Roser's camp coming off as a bit apologist for <em>status quo</em> economism. I do apologize for the caricature. Chris offers <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-minimum-growth-needed">these</a> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better">two</a> pieces as a fairer representation of Roser's views, and I am happy to pass them along. Roser is nothing if not quantitative, and in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-minimum-growth-needed">first piece</a> he uses data and a bunch of thought experiments to conclude that even in implausible scenario of complete global redistribution to his (reasonable) choice of a $30 per day poverty line, "the world economy would need to more than double."</p>
     <p>The question I would ask of him, and of you, dear reader, is what does that actually mean? Measuring things in dollars is nicely quantitative in form, but does that literally mean that the number of car and plane trips and stuff mined would have to double? If we expect, in this more equal world, that the composition of production and consumption would very dramatically shift, so perhaps there would be much less plane and personal car travel, and a much greater share of our collective resources devoted to maximizing very basic forms of food and shelter, does describing that as some multiple of dollars transacted under present patterns of consumption provide useful information? If "we" (as the mythical wise central planner) were implausibly able to reconfigure our collective physical and human resources towards the welfare of a materially equal humanity, we either would or would not achieve for all those humans a standard of living Roser or you or I might judge as "not poor". "30 dollars" becomes entirely meaningless, despite the fact it takes the physics-like form of a number and a unit. Perhaps Roser thinks his calculation predicts that no matter how we reconfigure the resources we have in our capacity to mobilize, we could not achieve "not poor", since that would require "growth".</p>
     <p>But "growth" itself is nothing more or less than a reconfiguration of resources that humanity has at our disposal. If we could "grow" to eliminate or substantially reduce poverty, a reconfiguration of how we deploy our resources must necessarily be able to achieve that result as well.</p>
     <p>If Roser would claim that <em>we won't know how</em> to get that degree of poverty reduction out of reconfigurations of resources until we have in a conventional economic sense "grown" to a much bigger economy, then he's smuggling in some very contestable assumptions about the relationship between economic growth in its conventional forms and measures, technology, and the variety of physical and social arrangements under which some semblance of human satisfaction might be achieved such that people might perceive themseves to be, and we might concede them to be, not poor.</p>

    <p>If you don't read Matt Stoller's newsletter <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/">Big</a>, you should. He writes about the consolidation of everything — recently <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/mrbeast-attacks-the-chocolate-monopoly">candy</a>, <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-the-biggest-tech-merger-of-all">videogames</a>, <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/can-a-writers-strike-save-hollywood">Hollywood</a>, <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/on-martin-shkreli-fication-and-fertility">generic drug purchasing power</a> <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/an-end-to-airline-consolidation">airlines</a>, everything — and is also a tribune for the very hopeful turn on antitrust under the Biden Administration and Lina Khan's FTC. We live in an era where clowns on televisions try to get us mad at the gub'mint and its taxes, while we are quietly taxed into penury and <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7263.html">precarity</a> by rents embedded in the price of everything we purchase. Don't look here, look there.</p>
    <p>A very important good we try to purchase is future well-being. When we "save" or "invest", we pay a price today in order to buy cashflows far into the future. When we purchase a home, we purchase a stream of shelter and amenities extending indefinitely in time, hoping to endow for ourselves and perhaps our children a secure and comfortable life.</p>
    <p>In general, we tend to think of the "FIRE" industry (finance, insurance, and real estate) in abstract terms. There are yields and premiums and earnings and buybacks and god knows what else. Just buy a frigging index fund, right? Don't look here. Look there. It's too confusing? Then trust me.</p>
    <p>No. What the FIRE industry sells is not abstract at all. The product it vends is future well-being. And like candy or plane tickets or drugs, whatever future well-being we purchase has a price.</p>
    <p>If you do not read John Hussman's market comment, <a href="https://www.hussmanfunds.com/category/comment/">you should</a>. He writes about financial markets, their history, investor psychology. But most fundamentally, he writes about price.</p>
    <p>Here is a graph from his <a href="https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc230619/">latest market comment</a>:</p><img src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/07/10/cornering-the-future/hussman-market-cap-gva-2023-06-19.png" width="100%">
    <p>"Nonfinancial market capitalization / Nonfinancial corporate gross-value added including estimated foreign revenues" sounds like something very complicated. But at base, this is just a graph of the price of US shares.</p>
    <p>Each year, US firms produce stuff that has some value when sold into the market. How much does it cost to buy shares representing a dollar of that recurring stream of gross production, going into (and hopefully growing into) the indefinite future?</p>
    <p>The absolute number isn't very meaningful, and you can (Hussman often does) compare it to other valuation measures's like Shiller CAPE (cycle-adjusted profits-to-earning ratio) or simple price-to-sales ratios. For all of these measures, the shape is broadly similar. From a nadir in the early 1980s, the measures rise, by the 1990s, to new heights relative to mid-20th-Century experience. Thereafter, despite some pretty wild fluctuations (the dot-com crash, the 2008 financial crisis), the attractor these measures oscillate around remains secularly higher in the post-1990s period than during the midcentury period.</p>
    <p>In other words, purchasing future well-being in the form of investment cash flows has grown a lot more expensive over this period.</p>
    <p>This was great news, if you purchased claims on future cash flows early in the period. You got your cash flows cheap, and now you also have the option to resell them to others at an appreciated price if you find you need purchasing power urgently.</p>
    <p>But this is terrible news for people in the market today, trying to endow future well-being for themselves or their family. Endowing a dollar's worth of future cashflow is, arguably, two to three times as expensive as it used to be.</p>
    <p>Unless, of course, future cash flows are going to continue to get more expensive even into the indefinite future. Then current buyers also can be the ones who bought early, and benefit from appreciation and an option to sell.</p>
    <p>If the good we were talking about were a cans of beans, it would be obvious that an increasing price might be good for people who already have cans of beans or who can produce them, but bad for people who need to eat but don't already have any beans. There is a divergence of interest between incumbent owners and potential buyers.</p>
    <p>But with financial assets, incumbent owners go on CNBC and say, "no, it's great that the price of beans has gone up, if you don't have any yet buy however many you can because the price is going to go up more!" Incumbent owners persuade potential buyers that there is no divergence of interest, they're just a bit late to the game, no big deal, just get in on the action now.</p>
    <p>When you are hungry and you can only buy three beans, you recognize claims like this are absurd. But give the beans a ticker symbol though and somehow it makes sense. In fact, though, what today's purchasers need is future flows of well-being, and those have grown exorbitantly expensive. Continued appreciation is a sales pitch, a hope, but not a thing you can reasonably know that you are buying.</p>
    <p>An exuberant stock market is great for current stockholders, at the expense of people who have not yet endowed their futures but would like to. It does not represent a "good economy". It represents a circumstance where some people are well off, and other people are screwed.</p>
    <p>Let's look at housing. From <a href="https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/">DQYDJ</a>, here's a graph of median US home prices, including (the green line) inflation-adjusted prices.</p><img src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/07/10/cornering-the-future/dqydj-median-home-prices-2023-07-10.png" width="100%">
    <p>Quite similarly to what we observed with stocks, we can see that beginning in the 1980s, the inflation-adjusted cost of a US home rises, ending up today at roughly double the midcentury norm.</p>
    <p>As with stocks, financial news people and incumbent homeowners think this is a great thing. We are building wealth!</p>
    <p>But to people who have not yet prepurchased comfort and shelter out into the indefinite future, this jump in price is just a jump in cost. Future well-being that in the past might have been affordable to them costs twice as much as it used to cost. Home price appreciation is not remotely an unalloyed good. It's good for incumbents, bad for new entrants into the future housing market. (Yes, median price masks quality improvements over time. No, that <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=16Weg">doesn't change the basic story</a>.)</p>
    <p>With housing, it is now pretty common to acknowledge that a coalition of incumbent of homeowners effectively forms a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6287.html">cartel</a> that uses regulation and other tools to maintain housing scarcity, in order to protect and enhance both the market values and amenity values of their homes. "NIMBYs", people who have already purchased future well-being in the form of housing, are not mere passive beneficiaries of some housing market lottery, but act to protect their interests at the expense of people still short a stream of future home and comfort.</p>
    <p>Why should we think it is any different with financial assets?</p>
    <p>Hussman, who has tracked for decades prices and reverting means was shocked and wrong-footed in the mid-2010s when, despite normally reliable signals that prices were too high, too extended, would soon give way... they did not. He <a href="https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc230619/">attributes</a> this to the Federal Reserve, which used near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing in order, pretty explicitly, to goose asset prices and counter weak demand:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>In every other market cycle across history, there was always a “limit” to speculation. Prior to 2008, the S&amp;P 500 had regularly lagged Treasury bills in conditions that we identified as “overvalued, overbought, and overbullish,” <em>even when our measures of market internals were favorable</em>. You’ll see that observation in my July 30, 2007 quote above. Those overextended conditions were often accompanied or quickly followed by deterioration in market internals, and it was best to act preemptively. This sequence unfolded in cycles across history, including 1973-1974, 2000-2002, and 2007-2009, as well as 1929-1932 based on imputed sentiment data.</p>
     <p>In 2008, the Federal Reserve embarked on its experiment of quantitative easing, driving the amount of zero-interest Fed liquidity (mainly bank reserves) to an unprecedented percentage of GDP. Nobody could actually put those speculative hot potatoes “into” stocks, or bonds, or anything else without the stuff coming right back “out” in the hands of a seller.</p>
     <p>The difficulty for our own discipline, particularly between 2012 and 2017, was that 16% of GDP in <em>zero-interest</em> liquidity – eventually peaking above 36% of GDP – made investors <em>lose their minds</em>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This all strikes me as plausible enough.</p>
    <p>But now interest rates are more than 5%, very historically normal, and quantitative easing has given way to quantitative tightening, and still markets levitate.</p>
    <p>There may well be a crash, later or sooner. But we've seen crashes in 2008 and 2020, and a downdraft in 2022, and still the attractor that prices oscillate around is the expensive new normal. Through all of the turbulence, unless you time things just right, a dollar of future corporate production in the post-1990s market costs roughly twice as much it did in the prior period, just like two bedrooms of comfort does.</p>
    <p>Maybe we should think of these markets — shares and housing — in unified terms as simply the market in future well-being. And maybe, like candy and eyeglasses and airplane tickets and films, we should wonder how somehow the market for this rather important good has been cornered. Maybe we should get Stoller on the case. We understand that a kind of dispersed, tacit, cartel makes use of means private and public, fair and foul, to sustain housing values. Given that the class of incumbent shareholders is almost perfectly coincident with the most politically enfranchised mass cohort in the United States, why should we expect that there wouldn't be such a cartel sustaining share prices?</p>
    <p>When we talk about housing and "NIMBYs" and all of that, we talk about supply constraints. If we could build lots more houses, then houses and so future well-being would be much cheaper than in a world where desirable housing is "artificially" scarce.</p>
    <p>In theory, new supply should also cause claims on future corporate production to become cheaper. As stock prices grow expensive, we might imagine that firms would issue new shares, since the cost of equity finance declines with increasing share valuation.</p>
    <p>But firms don't do that, because incumbent shareholders would not want them to diminish share scarcity, and flee from the putative signal of overvaluation. Instead firms take on debt to conduct buybacks, increasing scarcity (and "signaling undervaluation"), even at objectively nosebleed prices.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, new supply could come from new firms, who sell their shares cheaply to gain the funding they need to expand the "value added" they produce. But, if NEPA and CEQA and all of that are the workhorses of housing NIMBYism, maybe Marc Andreeson <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/26/5837638/the-ipo-is-dying-marc-andreessen-explains-why">had a point</a> and Sarbanes-Oxley and Reg FD serve the same role with respect to investable public shares. Private equity now buys up all the young firms, cartelizing current markets rather than juicing valuation multiples, but with the same effect upon price. You and I get stuck with the overpriced S&amp;P 500, and with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/29/private-equity-medical-practices-raise-prices/">overpriced anesthesia</a>. (And God knows we need the anesthesia!)</p>
    <p>Whatever the particular means, it seems pretty clear that like every almost other market in our once proud, now deteriorated market economy, some form of consolidation or coordination has made a cartel that now dominates the market for future well-being. The price of endowing a future has been jacked up well beyond what experience informs us is possible. Incumbent holders of claims on corporate production — or just the comforts of home — have those without over a barrel.</p>
    <p>How do we break a cartel over hope itself?</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>FD:</strong> I'm short US equity markets, rather painfully. Brother can you spare a dime?</p>

Drum is, reasonably, skeptical of the explanation advanced in the piece, that stricter contract terms largely explain the price difference. He asks, "[I]s our procurement really so screwed up that we pay twice as much for basically the same ship?" It should be no surprise that we pay twice as much for the same ship.

    <p>Kevin Drum <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/us-warships-cost-at-least-twice-as-much-as-they-should/">takes note</a> of a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/02/asia/japan-south-korea-naval-shipbuilding-intl-hnk-ml-dst/index.html">CNN piece</a>, which points out that Japan can build warships at one-half to one-third of the cost of United-States-built ships. Drum is, reasonably, skeptical of the explanation advanced in the piece, that stricter contract terms largely explain the price difference. He asks, "[I]s our procurement really so screwed up that we pay twice as much for basically the same ship?"</p>
    <p>It should be no surprise that we pay twice as much for the same ship. We pay at least twice as much for almost anything that must be domestically sourced and requires coordination and consent by many players. Alon Levy and their colleagues have been <a href="https://transitcosts.com/">documenting</a> this for years with respect to transit infrastructure costs. (See <a href="https://transitcosts.com/wp-content/uploads/TCP_Final_Report.pdf"><em>Understanding Transit Infrastructure costs in American Cities</em></a> by Eric Goldwyn, Alon Levy, Elif Ensari and Marco Chitti) They suggest, for example, that "the difference between the best and the worst procurement practices contributes a factor of 2 difference in construction costs." So Drum's a-bit-incredulous explanation is actually perfectly plausible.</p>
    <p>But procurement dysfunction is only one of many ills the Transit Costs Project document, and overpaying merely by a factor of two is a pretty good outcome for American public works. <a href="https://transitcosts.com/wp-content/uploads/TCP_Final_Report.pdf">Read the whole thing</a>, as they say, even if it is 424 pages. (No, I haven't.)</p>
    <p>A lot of things go wrong in a US context that just don't go wrong nearly as much in other places. Pretty much every factor of production costs more.</p>
    <p>One could — the Transit Cost Project very much did! — dive into the details. But I want to make a more sweeping, data-free attribution.</p>
    <p>On the other side of all the higher costs are workers, contractors, neighbors, politicians, and other stakeholders whose collaboration or acquiescence must be purchased in order to make a project work. In any country, for any project, each of these parties faces tradeoffs between mission-alignment ("Let's get this done!") and private interest ("We should be compensated.") If, in some altruistic paradise, all parties were purely mission-aligned and required no compensation, project costs would be very low. On the other hand, in a country where private interest absolutely dominates mission-alignment — where all players demand maximal compensation in exchange for any contribution, with little interest or regard for project success beyond getting what's theirs — then the costs of achieving a successful outcome will grow very large.</p>
    <p>It is silly to attribute cross-national differences in costs to personal or psychological differences. People are public-spirited everywhere. They are public-spirited in the United States. People are greedy everywhere. They are greedy in the United States.</p>
    <p>But what is not so silly to point out is that in the United States we are <em>structurally</em> greedy. At a macro-level, in the name of maximizing capitalist incentives to produce, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9713.html">our institutions are <em>designed</em> to encourage self-interested income-maximizing behavior</a> more than the institutions of other countries are. Low taxes for top-earners, tax-advantaged payouts from firms to shareholders, strong "intellectual property" rights, tolerance and even lionzation of firms that consolidate industries to extract rents, all combine to create an environment where the quantity of private income forgone for an aliquot of public-spiritedness is higher in the United States than it is almost anywhere else. At the executive and shareholder level, forgoing a dollar of private revenue in favor of making a great project work is a lot easier to do when that dollar would have been taxed at 90% anyway. Instead of maximizing incentives to produce, the American system has engineered a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5031.html">tax on virtue</a>, including the virtue of just delivering stuff that is great and works.</p>
    <p>At a micro-level, the dispersion and precarity of life outcomes in the United States make us all as individuals behave as if we are more greedy than we would if all that was at stake for us was a bit of luxury. I've described this before as "<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7263.html">predatory precarity</a>".</p>
    <p>In the United States, very basic goods like having your kid in a reliably safe and decent school, or having a home in a neighborhood where your family will be safe, or getting decent health care, are far from universal. In fact, these basic goods are scarce and price-rationed. Most of us do not enjoy them, and those who do pay through the nose for them. It does not seem like so much to ask for — a safe home, good schools, health care, some ability to keep these things through retirement. But increasingly, the only way one can secure these goods in the United States is to price whatever services one sells into the market aggressively, gain some market power and extract some rents of your own like a true capitalist hero.</p>
    <p>Competition is supposed to drive the price of goods and services towards "cost". But what does cost even mean? It must at least mean "subsistence", but what subsistence means is socially determined. Adam Smith, in a famous passage, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/adam-smith/the-wealth-of-nations/text/single-page">wrote</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably, though they had no linen. But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty, which, it is presumed, no body can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom, in the same manner, has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The United States is an extraordinarily class-stratified society, and people of various classes require certain goods and services as surely as an Englishman in Smith's time required linen shirts. Safe, decent, housing (which in the United States usually means either an apartment in an expensive urban district or a single family home); schools good enough not to restrict an ambitious child's chances (so a private school, or a public school in a rich neighborhood); a car for each adult that's not a jalopy; health insurance premiums; some retirement savings — these are <em>de minimis</em> requirements of a decent life for a professional in the United States, and they cost. In the United States, they cost more than professionals in almost any other country could possibly afford from their own salaries. American professionals behave as if they are more greedy than their colleagues elsewhere, because they have to be more greedy in order to afford social goods that are more universal, much less scarce, elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Everything we can't source externally is more expensive in the United States because we are all, desperately, striving to make the labor, goods, or services that we sell — or else the hold-up costs we can impose — expensive. Our institutions both encourage and demand that of us, by letting the most successful enjoy outsize rewards and social power, by threatening us with submersion in American social pathology should we become unable to pay all the tolls and rents we must continually pay in order to <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6891.html">segregate</a> ourselves from it.</p>
    <p>So warships and subways — big projects where lots of people each get to demand a payout, as compensation for goods and services, as compensation for risk-bearing, as a form of political persuasion, in exchange for acquiescing rather than suing, as a result of costly lawsuits — are expensive in the United States. We make them that way, one eager, ambitious, desperate hand at a time.</p>
    <p>And then we are shocked. Really, genuinely, shocked. Because we really, actually believed that, if nothing else, these institutions in which we ostentatiously and proudly entrapped ourselves would deliver "economic efficiency". That was why we did this to ourselves.</p>

    <p>We live in a moment when <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html">fascism</a> is ascending. That's bad news.</p>
    <p>But who are the fascists? We sometimes have <a href="https://johnganz.substack.com/p/both-worse">elaborate</a> <a href="https://shadihamid.substack.com/p/desantis-derangement-syndrome-and">debates</a> <a href="https://damonlinker.substack.com/p/desantis-is-bad-but-trump-is-still">about</a> questions like <em>Is Ron DeSantis a fascist?</em>.</p>
    <p>I think that the question is ill-formed. Outside of Mussolini's Italy and a few performative weirdoes, fascism is not an identity people adopt. It is not an ideology that people support. The better way to understand fascism is as a syndrome that people are in the throes of. The identity "fascists" adopt is, first, <em>patriotic opponent of insidious enemies who threaten what is virtuous in my society</em>. Then, in a later stage, <em>devoted and obedient supporter of the great leader who will vanquish our enemies</em>.</p>
    <p>That describes "rank and file" fascists. What about leaders of movements who seek power by manufacturing and scapegoating insidious enemies? This does describe Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump, Chris Rufo, or Michael Knowles. About the latter (who called for the “eradication of transgenderism from public life.”), Radley Balko perceptively <a href="https://radleybalko.substack.com/p/shrugging-in-the-shadow-of-a-monster">writes</a>...</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>I don’t think Knowles yearns to personally murder trans people. I don’t think he longs to direct other people to murder trans people on his behalf. I don’t think he fantasizes about the prospect of trans people being murdered.</p>
     <p>But I do think he and too many like him knowingly, willingly, and eagerly court the praise, likes, follows, speech attendances, and novelty gift budgets of people who do.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the sense I described above, these leaders are less "fascist" than the people upon whose adulation they hope to rise. DeSantis is a calculating chameleon, who governed for a while as a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23622719/ron-desantis-2024-presidential-opportunism">good government conciliator</a>. He just decided that his best play to beat Trump in a Presidential primary was to manufacture an insidious enemy called "wokeism", then ostentatiously deploy the coercive power of the state to vanquish it, whatever the human cost. Echoing Balko, I don't think DeSantis yearns to personally murder trans people. I don't think he cares one way or another about "gender ideology" (or at least that he did before he started to take actions that might demand that he persuade himself, in order to avoid cognitive dissonance and feelings of guilt). Sexual minorities are appealing sources of an internal enemy for conservative political entrepreneurs. They provoke fear and disgust at a visceral level among many conservatives, and they are supported by social liberals who can conveniently be blamed for them.</p>
    <p>So is DeSantis a fascist? I doubt that he identifies, to himself or to anyone else, as a fascist. Almost no one does. And DeSantis is not a fascist in the rank-and-file sense, caught in the thrall of a kind of negative ardor for the enemies he has invented. Perhaps eventually he will get high on his own supply, but at the start, it's nothing personal.</p>
    <p>I think a useful way to describe people like DeSantis — and Trump, and Rufo, and Knowles — is "Sméagols".</p>
    <p>Sméagol is the character in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> who lusts for "my precious", a ring of power under whose influence he transforms into both a pathetic wretch and a kind of monster ("Gollum"). DeSantis is willing to conjure the social dynamic of fascism in the service of his rise to power. He may not intend the awful consequences often associated with that dynamic. Indeed he may hope that once it elevates him, he can moderate and set it aside.</p>
    <p>But just because you may be leader doesn't mean you are the master of social forces much deeper and more powerful than any single person. Patriotic hatred of — even <a href="https://johnganz.substack.com/p/the-browning-of-the-right">delicious sadism towards</a> — the internal enemy that you conjure is not something you can just switch off in your public. To lead, whether as President or dictator, is a dance of following your public at least as much as you compel your public to follow you. Your power, your ring, is an identity constructed in the negative spaces of the existential enemy you have manufactured. When your power wobbles, when you feel threatened, you lean into that. You have to. Otherwise you might be exposed, just an ordinary person, a failed manipulator, a little man behind the curtain who has deceived and disappointed a lot of second amendment enthusiasts.</p>
    <p>It's not that "Sméagols" are fascists. It's just that the apocalyptic dangers of provoking and nurturing a fascist social dynamic are risks they are willing to take in the service of their ambitions.</p>
    <p>Is that really so wrong?</p>

      <title>Decommodification and health care utilization</title>

    <p>I am listening to <a href="https://www.leftanchor.com/e/episode-276-the-ends-of-freedom/">an episode</a> of the <a href="https://www.leftanchor.com/"><em>Left Anchor</em> podcast</a>. Among other great things, guest <a href="https://markpaulecon.com/">Mark Paul</a> calls not just for universal health care, but for "decommodifying" health care.</p>
    <p>Health care, he reminds us, is <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jay/health_class/Readings/Lecture01/arrow.pdf">famously</a> a festival of market failures. Absenting health care provision — like we exempt, say, national security provision — entirely from consumer markets makes some sense, even from a neoliberal perspective. Regulated markets are how neoliberals usually address market failure, but in principle if, say, barriers to informed consumer choice are severe enough, nonmarket provision might well be more efficient than relying upon consumer discipline at all.</p>
    <p>But if consumers literally bear no cost at all for the health care they receive, won't they overconsume? The usual story with "Medicare For All" is that we'd gain some efficiency from eliminating the private insurance layer (which costs tremendous complexity and a whole lot of money) but we'd increase aggregate medical provision. The presently uninsured would enjoy new care and people who now ration their own access for fear of financial burden would make greater use of the system, yielding health benefits. But this would also increase demand and cost.</p>
    <p>Paul's use of the term "decommodification" had me wondering, however, about what reforms might mean for the <em>supply side</em> of health care provision, and how that might affect utilization. As Nick Rowe has pointed out many times, the usual condition of under which commodities are provided under capitalism is <a href="https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2010/11/excess-supply-under-monopolistic-competition.html">supplier market power</a>. Suppliers are eager to supply. <a href="https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/01/the-war-on-demand-and-the-short-side-rule-.html">It is easy</a> to buy things, while sales is a difficult job.</p>
    <p>This seems as true for health care in the United States as it is for other services. We are bombarded by ads for clinics and pharmaceutics. Television commercials ask us to try on diagnoses they suggest, and then ask our doctors. Our doctors are paid (via a complicated melange of sources) more for each service than what it costs to provide. Like shoe-sellers, they do well when they are busy, they go bust when patients cease to come.</p>
    <p>John Kenneth Galbraith (via <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2023/05/what-the-people-want.html">Chris Dillow</a>) writes</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The fact that wants can be synthesised by advertising, catalysed by salesmanship and shaped by the discreet manipulations of the persuaders shows that they are not very urgent. A man who is hungry need never be told of his need for food.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Under capitalism a persuasive apparatus emerges to sell us unnecessary baubles. Fine. There are worse things than having baubles. But superfluous health care services impose deadweight losses besides the financial transfers they provoke. Surgeries are painful and bring risks of complication. Medication has side effects, sometimes very serious. Drugs <a href="https://www.evanhughes.co/the-hard-sell">aggressively sold</a> provoke addictions that destroy lives, families, and communities.</p>
    <p>If the ordinary result of commodification under capitalism is imperfect competition favoring sellers and then aggressive persuasion to maximize profits, then wouldn't we expect commodified health care to be overutilized? Wouldn't we expect the (important! good!) health care produced by the system be offset somewhat by manufacture of disease and addiction, matched by provider profits? And isn't this exactly what most of us think we see?</p>
    <p>The cost of profit-motivated health-care overutilization is higher than the sum of individual disabilities and addiction occasioned by unnecessary care. The phenomenon has a much broader social consequences. It profoundly undermines the public's trust in education and expertise.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>The anti-vaxx movement is rendered credible to its adherents almost entirely by the conjecture that the pharmaceutical industry is very interested in getting us to take their products, and less interested in our heath.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Anti-trans activists, when confronted by the <a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/gender-affirming-care-for-trans-youth-is-neither-new-nor-experimental-a-timeline-and-compilation-b4bb8375d797">strong consensus among medical providers</a> in favor of cautious, incremental gender-affirmative care, argue that medical associations are corrupted by providers' interest in a lucrative new care market. <em>How can you trust these people who are selling us the sterilization of our children?</em></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A health care system that passes off sometimes debilitating baubles as medical necessities becomes hard to take seriously in its advice about what is actually a medical necessity. Which makes it hard for us as a society to come to consensus, even when — as in the case of most vaccines and most trans care — the medical benefits are very real.</p>
    <p>I think that it is certainly true, as the conventional case goes, that "decommodifying" health care would increase utilization by people currently discouraged from accessing health care for financial reasons. And to the degree that "decommodification" just means health care <em>gratis</em> at the point of service without making deeper changes to the system, then that will be the dominant effect.</p>
    <p>But what if by "decommodification" we mean something more, if we mean to alter the institutions and incentives surrounding health care provision so that there is <em>not</em> a profit motive attached to ever more provision? How much would any increase in utilization due to more inclusive access might be offset by a <em>reduction</em> in demand we might describe as induced by providers who profit from erring on the side of more provision? Could a decommodified health care system find ways of delivering equal or better health outcomes from fewer procedures, visits, and medications, rather than just delivering more to more people?</p>
    <p>If so, then sure, that increases the political case for wholesale reform, under the banner of "Medicare For All" or whatever. Medicare For All may be cheaper than we think, if it helps move us towards buying outcomes rather than procedures.</p>
    <p>But more than that, it is impossible to sustain modernity under conditions where the expertise we must rely upon is undermined by financial interests. This is a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7317.html">broader problem</a> than just medicine. I don't think we'll really address it until we <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5031.html">reduce the sway</a> of financial motivation by <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9713.html">reducing</a> <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7629.html">dispersion of outcomes</a>. (Mark Paul, in the <a href="https://www.leftanchor.com/e/episode-276-the-ends-of-freedom/">same podcast</a>, proposes an income floor <em>and cap</em>. Hurrah!)</p>
    <p>But medicine is the signal example of expertise in most people's lives. A world in which doctors can't be trusted because their financial incentives and patient welfare diverge is a world in which it will be hard for people to trust almost any form of professional expertise. We are seeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles_resurgence_in_the_United_States">measles</a> again. We are seeing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/health/polio-cdc-rockland-county/index.html">polio</a>. <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html">Fascist inimicalization</a> of sexual minorities is rendered plausible to much of the public in part by perceived corruption of experts on whose work we must rely if we are to discredit and overcome prejudice.</p>
    <p>For reasons beyond accessibility and cost reduction, we need to think about decommodifying medicine. Along with expertise in general.</p>

    <p>Everywhere the humans have been, and especially everywhere the humans still are, there are ghosts. We haunt. There is nothing more fundamental. We leave bits of us — artifacts, fragments of memory, graffiti, letters, legends — everywhere that we have been. Those traces reanimate, like Sea Monkey eggs poured into brine, among humans who eventually encounter them. Things long dormant come to life.</p>
    <p>They can raze the Pei Dormitories and rechristen New College "DeSantis University". They can exile the the faculty and recruit chidren raised by televangelists. They can scrub every surface with bleach and hydroxychloroquine, desperate to erase any trace of us.</p>
    <p>But we who <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/27/new-college/index.html">are now dead</a>, we lived there. We loved there. We lived brief lives so extraordinary there that the rest of the world, the rest of our own lives, faded dim. That cannot be erased.</p>
    <p>It won't be.</p>
    <p>As long as there is a college of any kind on that remarkable, beautiful campus, as long as there are kids who live there and a community striving to teach and learn, there will be resonances. The collective adolescence will draw our poltergeist.</p>
    <p>Even now, our usurpers live only in our negative spaces. Or in weak caricatures of our negative spaces that their own smallness and madness have hallucinated for them. Pity them. They make so much noise, they stomp gleefully upon the wildflowers. But despite their professed religion, no spirit stirs beneath their ruckus. They croak sound with no echoes. Their footprints are nothing to time and wind. Wildflowers grow back, thick in bright colors, from detritus of root and seed.</p>
    <p>Haunt. Small men in large pulpits come and go. There have never been smaller men than these.</p>
    <p>Haunt. Tell our stories. Leave traces, sprinkle breadcrumbs, in these electric entrails we now inhabit. In places where they can find them, not in the ever-shifting self-eradicating folds of Mark Zuckerberg's gigabit anus.</p>
    <p>What we leave, the kids will find. They will want to know. The transcendant is rare in our difficult country. New College is a wellspring. Children whose upbringing has been constraint masquerading as rapture, cruelty masquerading as civilization, threat masquerading as sanctuary, will thirst all the more for the water.</p>
    <p><em>Trustees</em>, they call themselves, as if anyone would trust them. <em>President</em>. How grand. These people are parade floats transecting only briefly the center of the universe. Vulgar, imposing, made of nothing but hot air smelling stale like sweat and fear. We have indulged them too much already with diplomacy and outrage, with any kind of attention at all. They are unworthy of attention at all.</p>
    <p>Haunt.</p>
    <p>And stay, if you can. Whether you are student, staff, or faculty, it will be a trial. But an even better medium for haunting than an abandonned house is a living body possessed by spirit and memory. By no means give those motherfuckers any money. But if you can stand it, if you can put up with their harrying and petulence and dishonesty and cruelty, stay. A river runs through you.</p>
    <p>And love. The kids who will come, whether they are recruited on baseball scholarships or from community colleges (a <a href="https://www.ncf.edu/admissions/transfer-students/guaranteed-admission/">genuinely wonderful initiative</a>) or whether they are our own kids, the kids are not our enemy. They are us and we are them. As long as they live and learn as fully and richly and wildly as we did, nothing can be lost. Flickering in a windstorm conjured by fools, we offer a flame. Only we know its warmth and technicolor brilliance. We offer it in love, despite the gusts and gales.</p>
    <p>It won't be easy for these new kids either. This storm is meant to keep them pliantly in their shelters.</p>
    <p>We were not so pliant. Neither will they be.</p>

    <p>Systemic questions are boring.</p>
    <p>It is so much more fun when we have a scandal — corruption! sex! ‐ than to drone on about our voting system. A scandal brings excitement, outrage, food fights on Twitter, entertaining cable news. Who the fuck cares about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger's_law">Duverger's Law</a> and <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a>?</p>
    <p>But Jesus Fucking Christ.</p>
    <p>We all understand that, in the United States, our current electoral system reliably elevates sociopaths. Then we are shocked!, shocked! that they are sociopaths.</p>
    <p>Our electoral system rewards — nay, requires — corruption, as without campaign cash, most candidates have no hope.</p>
    <p>The primary system and the small-money donations game filter for outrage entrepreneurs. The big-money donations game filters for sycophants to plutocrats. Pick your poison, then poison us all.</p>
    <p>Donald Trump is not the problem. He's a symptom. As are the prosecutorial showboats like Adam Schiff who oh so valiantly attack him. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1478929920963827">Kayfabe</a> was the metaphor, but it's wrong to imagine it started with Trump.</p>
    <p>Whatever these people are doing, they are not meaningfully representing us. They are not finding solutions to the problems that most vex us. There's a <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/groucho_marx_122546">Groucho Marx</a> aspect to our current system. Anyone willing to do what it takes to get elected and keep the job under our decayed institutions is unlikely to do the job well.</p>
    <p>And we are misgoverned. We are so badly misgoverned. We are <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/25/1164819944/live-free-and-die-the-sad-state-of-u-s-life-expectancy">literally dying</a> from misgovernment. It's a big fucking deal.</p>
    <p>Giving your sociopaths a slim margin over the other team of sociopaths is not going to solve the problem. There is no one you can elect who will "make a difference" when the system in which they operate is what's broken. The only way they can make a difference is if they change the system that rewards their misgovernment.</p>
    <p>Yes, it matters, as a kind of holding action, that the very worst of them shouldn't get elected. But all the money we send to ActBlue or WinRed is just a fucking shakedown. The <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7759.html">politics industry</a> finances itself opulently by holding us for ransom. We are provoked to pay so that something terrible won't happen.</p>
    <p>Not a lot of positive good is likely to come out of a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/21/two-parties-make-us-stupid/index.html">cage match</a> between two sorted, polarized parties, from which we elect representatives whose main job is attracting cash, for whom governing is at best a side hustle, and who understand that taking a meaningful position beyond the consensus of their party invites attack ads and is electoral poison.</p>
    <p>Things work a little better than you'd expect from a fair description of our actual system. Maybe there's some hope in that. But not very much hope.</p>
    <p>We have to change the structure of our democracy.</p>
    <p>We are in a foreign policy environment where catastrophically destructive war or even nuclear annihilation are plausible outcomes. We need to act with care, deliberation, and wisdom. Instead, political incentives militate either towards cartoon hawkishness or dogmatic isolationism, almost regardless of the actual circumstances. We need leaders who can actually negotiate and deliberate, who can understand nuance and consider compromise without those words becoming euphemisms for abandonning vital commitments.</p>
    <p>We have to change the structure of our democracy.</p>
    <p>And we can! Yes we can! Almost none of what ails us is embedded in our hard-to-change Constitution.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>If our pustulent rotted Congress could rise above their pustulence and rottedness for a day or two, they could change the character of the antidemocratic Senate. It could become a body that elevates broadly popular, consensus-oriented statesmen rather than partisan sociopaths. It would take nothing more than an Act of Congress to <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/24/two-kinds-of-representation/index.html">insist</a> that Senators be elected by approval vote.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>We <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">could ensure</a> that at least four major parties emerge among the public and take seats in the House of Representatives, transforming today's stalemated trench warfare between implacably opposed camps into a more constructive dynamic where parties on their own can neither pass or block anything, where coalition building works while kneecapping a rival just advantages a different rival.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>We could insist that elections be solely publicly financed.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>We could properly fund Congressional staffs so they needn't outsource the basic work of legislating to think tanks bought by plutocrats and lobbyists working for industries eager to write their own laws.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>We could even <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7964.html">build a Supreme Court</a> that would be trustworthy.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any of these things, or all of them, could be accomplished by a simple Act of Congress.</p>
    <p>Structure may not be as salacious as who's grabbing whom by the pussy, who bought whom by some clever <a href="https://elk.zone/fosstodon.org/@interfluidity/110273134173554579">or not so clever</a> means that the Supreme Court decides is not corruption.</p>
    <p>Something in our lizard brains seeks out human villains we can mock, punish, destroy. Structural change is not so exciting. It seems dry.</p>
    <p>But it is so much more powerful. Transcend your lizard blame for a second, and prioritize what fucking matters. With enough pressure, even the sociopaths we currently elect can be cornered into doing the right thing.</p>

      <title>Two kinds of representation</title>

    <p>In conversations about democratic institutions, I wish we would be clearer about two, very different kinds of representation.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, we want one single person to represent an entire diverse public. In the United States, when we elect a president, he or she must look after the interests of all Americans. When we elect a senator, that person's job is to represent the state in its entirety, rather than any faction or party. Let's call this "one-for-all" representation.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, we define representative <em>bodies</em> whose role is to serve as "minipublics". In the US, the House of Representatives is the most prominent example. In a representative minipublic, the role of an individual member is not to stand for everyone, but to represent a particular faction or party. Here what representation means is to <em>include</em>, in roughly proportionate numbers, members of <em>every</em> faction and party. Let's call this "everybody-in" representation.</p>
    <p>These two kinds of representation are profoundly different. Any conversation about electoral systems that fails to recognize this will be stunted from the start.</p>
    <p>It is great and right that somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene sits in the House of Representatives. At least 1% of the US public shares her rather particular take on things, so there should be at least four Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-ish Representatives in the US House.</p>
    <p>I don't like her views. But that's precisely why I need her there. Because my political system can only be legitimate if it includes and enfranchises the factions I like least. If only people whose politics I consider sane are represented, then our claim to pluralism is a sham. A system where those beyond some faction's definition of the pale are shut out by self-appointed moral betters would not be liberal democracy. It's on all of us, by some combination of persuasion, community, and actually good governance to ensure that our worst fringes gain very limited support in the population, so that we can give them full representation in our institutions, genuinely take their concerns into consideration, and still govern well. I am genuinely grateful for the role Marjorie Taylor Greene plays in the House of Representatives.</p>
    <p>But a person like Marjorie Taylor Greene should never sit in the Senate. Even if 51% of voters in the state of Georgia absolutely <em>love</em> Marjorie Taylor Greene, so long as most of the other 49% feel about her politics the way, well, I do, she could not possibly represent the interests of the state of Georgia writ large.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, under our current electoral system, she certainly would be elected senator with those numbers. That is a mistake.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting">Plurality voting</a>, how we mostly elect people in the United States, is an awful way to decide which single person will represent a whole body of people. Rather than choosing a representative for everyone, it sets up a factional contest over who will be represented at all, and who will be ignored or worse.</p>
    <p>Plurality voting is a bad voting system for almost any purpose. But, as the American <em>status quo</em>, it is not <em>as</em> bad for the House of Representatives as it is for other offices. In each Congressional district, some factional champion will win, and other factions will be shut out. But what matters most is the composition of the House as a whole, not who wins a particular district. If (in the <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">destructive</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/04/21/two-parties-make-us-stupid/index.html">binary</a> that plurality voting encourages) 60% of the public belongs to one faction and 40% to another, and if 60% of the factional battles are won by the larger faction and 40% by the smaller, then the chamber will be representative, even though in each district many individuals won't be meaningfully represented by "their" representative. Our assumption of proportional victories is a pretty big "if", and we know that partisan gerrymandering exists precisely to render it false. But when we want "everybody-in" representation, it's at least <em>possible</em> for plurality voting to yield not-ridiculously-disproportionate outcomes.</p>
    <p>When we want "one-for-all" representation, however, when we are electing presidents or senators or governors or mayors, plurality voting is viciously inadequate. It's not just a stump speech: If we are to have a functioning democracy, especially during periods of dissensus and polarization, we really do need a person who can be president "not of Red America, not of Blue America, but of the United States of America".</p>
    <p>At all levels of government, we want executives who can straddle factional lines and work with everybody, people who may be no faction's first choice but whom everyone can live with. The factional contest that plurality voting sets up is entirely inappropriate to "one-for-all" representation. If it is even remotely plausible that a faction can win an election by "turning out the base" (meaning exciting the most committed factionalists even where that might turn-off many outsiders), then you have an electoral system that threatens to deliver something between disenfranchisement and tyranny to the factions that lose the election.</p>
    <p>This is the American <em>status quo</em>. One minute our democracy is under threat by Donald Trump, the next minute we are living under the "Biden regime". In either case, half the country feels disenfranchised and threatened, because so much of the power of the state becomes concentrated in the hands of a dedicated factionalist whose faction they oppose.</p>
    <p>We don't need to repeal the Constitution to fix this. We just need to understand the different kinds of representation inherent in different Constitutional offices, and tailor our election rules accordingly. General elections for President and Senator, in every state, should be by <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a>, or some very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_voting">similar</a> system. Elections for the House of Representatives should be conducted under any of the many systems that reliably deliver <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">proportional representation</a> and are resistant to gerrymandering.</p>
    <p>At the state and local levels, just like at the Federal level, we should always begin by asking of each elected position, are we electing "one-for-all" — one person to represent everyone — or are we constituting a body that should include advocates of every viewpoint or faction, "everybody-in"?</p>
    <p>And when we find ourselves in arguments about what would be "the best" electoral system, we should remember that we'll need at least two, for these two very different kinds of representation.</p>

    <p>Why do we want democracy anyway?</p>
    <p>There are two intertwined goods that we hope democracy will deliver:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p><strong>Democracy legitimates government action.</strong> If we believe that what our government does has been decided by and for the public as a whole, rather than by and to the advantage of some elite or faction, then we are likely to concede that it's legitimate. We're less likely to resist, whether by quietly defying the law when we can get away with it or overtly struggling against the state.</p>
      <p>Legitimacy is both a <em>per se</em> good and an instrumental good. If we think the system we live under is legitimate, that fact alone makes us feel better about our lives than if we think we think we are coerced by a corrupt and oppressive state. More than that, legitimacy renders us all more willing to behave in ways that make state action more likely to succeed, and so improves social coordination and enhances state capacity.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p><strong>Democracy enables high quality decision-making.</strong> A tyranny or aristocracy will act with limited access to the values and interests of the public it governs, and will often project its own perspectives and interests on the broader public. So even when it means to act in the public interest, it will fail to do so. No faction has a monopoly on insight, and every faction has blind spots, prejudices, and parochial concerns. Democracy — in theory, at its best — would recruit the entire public into an intelligent process of deliberation, yielding higher quality decisions than any faction governing alone would arrive at.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>These goods are mutually reinforcing. A state that consistently makes high quality decisions will be perceived as more legitimate than one that seems always to err. When state action is widely held to be legitimate, public cooperation will expand the range of choices the government can succeed at executing, enabling a higher quality of decisions than a government whose actions will be stymied by public torpor or active resistence.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, a system that divides the public into two aggressively competing, highly cohesive factions renders an intelligent process of deliberation impossible. It is not hard to understand why.</p>
    <p>Intelligent deliberation requires that there exist some agent capable of weighing competing ideas without too much prejudice. It is fine — it is necessary! — that there are passionate interests on one side or another of any debate. But passionate interests don't deliberate. They advocate.</p>
    <p>You can't make a court only from the prosecution and the defense. Who would listen and synthesize the evidence? The prosecution and defense have their roles to play. But deliberation is only effective when there are judges and juries beholden to neither side, able to consider competing claims on their merits.</p>
    <p>Of course we will never achieve perfect neutrality, objectivity, fairness, independence in our fallen human world. But these characteristics can exist in importantly different degrees. Institutions that create space for neutral-ish adjudicating parties will be capable of better decisionmaking than institutions under which prejudiced parties simply struggle for the power to impose their own way.</p>
    <p>When a society becomes polarized into only two competing factions, each of which takes opposite sides over the set of issues under public contestation, there cease to be neutral-ish parties. Each faction will learn to punish deviance by individuals within its orbit, because dissent on any of the portfolio of positions one faction has adopted weakens the faction as a political coalition. A two-party system risks converging over time into highly disciplined coalitions, because tolerating dissent within a party creates opportunities for the other, much worse, party to exploit.</p>
    <p>A two-party system is a zero-sum game. Whatever weakens my side, strengthens the other side. Matters that should be decided with attention to actual facts about the world become subsumed by concerns over who will be helped and who will be hurt by a given position. No issue, individually, can outweigh the catastrophe that would result if the other side achieved greater power, so neither party can afford to consider any issue on its merits at all. The implcations with regard to <em>who</em> will rule wholly outweigh questions of <em>what</em> should best be done.</p>
    <p>In a multiparty system, on any given question, there may be factions without much skin in the game. The environmentally-focused Green Party may not have strong priors about education reforms, and may not perceive its own electoral prospects as being very connected to that issue. If that is so, members of the Green Party can actually consider those questions on the merits, perhaps adjudicating some controversy between a labor party committed to teachers' interests as workers and a liberal party trying to maximize efficiencies by minimizing expenditures. On any given issue, you'd ideally like the deciding "swing" party to have minimal commitments, to be capable of listening to advocates and forming independent judgments.</p>
    <p>Multiple parties alone cannot guarantee this, of course. If parties tightly align to form a governing coalition, then our hypthetical Green Party might just defer to its coalition partner. And what is formally a two party system need not foreclose the possibility of space for neutral-ish factions. In the United States, before our two parties had sorted themselves so well into homogenous, disciplined entities, the existence of "Rockefeller Republicans" and conservative Southern Democrats meant that beneath the party brands sat a multiplicity of groups, whose positions in controversies often failed to hew to party lines.</p>
    <p>Intelligent decisionmaking under democracy is less a matter of the number of formal political parties participate and more a question of how fluid coalitions among factions are. If every question is going to be settled in Democrats-vs-Republicans terms, you will have a stupid polity. If party discipline is weak and factions shift, so that on any given question less interested factions take positions largely on their merits, you might manage an intelligent polity even with only two formal parties.</p>
    <p>What matters is that there be sufficient diversity and fluidity within the legislature that the swing vote usually comes from factions that has no strong, prior interest in the question considered, and no binding loyalty to any of the more interested factions. For any given question, there needs to be a judge and jury, as well as a prosecution and defense, among the legislature.</p>
    <p>The political science consensus, I think, is that parliamentary systems under which the executive is selected by the legislature are superior to US-style presidential systems. Parliamentary systems reduce the danger of paralyzing, destructive, conflict between legislature and president, both of which claim a mandate from the people.</p>
    <p>The argument I make here runs a bit contrary to this consensus. When a governing coalition must be maintained within the legislature, even if there are formally mutiple parties, the parliament risks becoming effectively a two-party chamber, defined by those who are in government and those who are in opposition. Under a presidential system, discipline within the legislature need not be maintained in order to sustain control of the executive. Parties not attached to strong coalitions can afford more independence of judgment, creating space for meaningful fluidity and neutrality inside the legislature.</p>
    <p>However, in order to reduce conflict between a fluid and deliberative legislature and an externally chosen executive, the president should be elected via a system likely to elevate more neutral and diplomatic candidates, rather than committed factionalists.</p>
    <p>If I could wave a magic wand, the United States President would be elected by <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a>, which tends to elevate consensus candidates. The House of Representatives would be chosen by some form of proportional representation, designed — because the structure of the system does determine these things! — to elevate four to six political parties. Multiplicity of formal party may not guarantee a fluid multiplicity of faction. But it would help encourage it, and break the cul-de-sac of strongly sorted, binary factions in which the US is now stuck. (Senators, who are charged with representing whole vast states, should also be elected by approval voting. They should be consensus figures, people nearly all of their constituents can live with, rather than factionalists who alienate half their publics.)</p>
    <p>Our current system and situation render deliberation a sham in the service of factional power. This makes us collectively stupid. Which discredits our democracy, and the very idea of democracy.</p>
    <p>If you want to save democracy, it's not enough to fight the authoritarians in the other party, whichever party you now identify with. We have to reform our electoral system.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>p.s. I usually recommend <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/36918">Lee Drutman's book</a> on this stuff, and see no reason not to recommend it again now.</p>

    <p>Taiwan's status has settled into a kind of pissing match between the United States and China. I think this is very bad.</p>
    <p>From an American perspective, Xi Jinping's China seems increasingly assertive, impatient, and threatening. US officials publicly worry that China might blockade or invade Taiwan <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/753bec2b-9c55-49a8-9d34-7c286af505f3">at any time</a>.</p>
    <p>From a Chinese perspective, the United States seems to be openly flouting its "one China" policy under which the United States <a href="http://www.taiwandocuments.org/communique03.htm">claimed</a> to have "no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China's internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan.'"</p>
    <p>When senior US officials make high-profile public visits to Taiwan, that is perceived almost universally — within China, but also by American and Western publics — as supporting a posture of adversarial defiance by Taiwan towards China. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vive_le_Qu%C3%A9bec_libre">(Vive le Québec libre!)</a> Given increasingly negative perceptions of China's behavior with respect to Xinjiang and Hong Kong, supporting Taiwanese resistance is popular with Western publics and therefore attractive to Western politicians. Of course, members of the US Congress and Taiwanese leaders have every right to meet with one another, wherever they wish, without regard to China's views on the matter.</p>
    <p>That one has a right to do a thing, however, does not imply that it's a righteous thing to do. Asserting ones rights should in general be a last, rather than first, resort. In ordinary life, nearly all of the time, we try to act with sufficient consideration of those our actions might affect that the question of rights never comes up. We assert rights only when someone will object, but we decide to act anyway.</p>
    <p>It is important that we can and do assert rights, that we have liberties that can overcome other peoples' objections. But it's also wise, when it is possible, to try to address people's concerns rather than jumping directly to an adversarial assertion of rights. Even when in the end no agreement can be reached and ultimately we do assert rights, the exercise of having made a real attempt — of expressing some regret rather than just glee when we disregard another's preference — goes some way towards mitigating the damage.</p>
    <p>As readers can tell, I view events like Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan more through a lens of destructive showboating than courageous freedom fighting. I care a great deal about Taiwan's continuing freedom and prosperity, and don't think the United States should in any sense shirk its commitments to the island. But our commitment should be to chart a course that will actually, rather than symbolically, support the welfare of Taiwan. The way relations between the United States and China have spiraled makes a destructive war too likely. The goal of the United States should be live up to our commitments in a way that prevents such a war.</p>
    <p>The keystone of the United States' policy with respect to Taiwan should be <em>mutuality</em>. Our position should be that we support any change in Taiwan's status so long as it is voluntarily agreed by both China's government and the <em>de facto</em> government of Taiwan. <em>Voluntarily</em> is important. The United States supports Taiwan, militarily and otherwise, only so that it cannot be coerced by China. If, at some point in the future, a convergence occurs so that China and Taiwan become ready to conclude a "peaceful reunification", that would be wonderful. If, in some future, friendly and mutually beneficial cross-strait relations lead China to become less concerned with exerting formal sovereignty over Taiwan and the parties jointly negotiate a more autonomous status for the island, that would be great too.</p>
    <p>What the United States should oppose is any unilateral or coercive change in status, by either party. If China were to try to take Taiwan by force, there is little question now, and there should be little question, that the United States would intervene in the island's defense. That would be a catastrophe for all concerned, but the logic of deterrence demands risking catastophe. Especially in the wake of the Ukraine experience, I (like Joe Biden) don't see much benefit in "strategic ambiguity". The worst kind of deterrence is a policy sufficiently uncertain that the party you seek to deter risks adventure, but sufficiently serious that when it does you end up expending treasure or blood or maybe provoking an apocalypse in response. Deterrence strikes me as a Yoda-esque affair. Do, or do not.</p>
    <p>Even while we deter China, the United States should make clear, plainly and publicly, that we would not support, would not recognize, and would not defend Taiwan in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence. Does the US ever say this? Seems like an obvious thing. It is not, as China frequently implies, the United States' policy to encourage separatism in Taiwan. The United States should forthrightly and frequently say so.</p>
    <p>On questions like how Taiwan's economic and cultural interests should be represented in multilateral organizations and around the world, the United States should encourage negotiation and consensus rather than take sides in symbolic but inflammatory pissing matches. Where China cannot be appeased, the United States should informally intermediate, so that Taiwan's substantive concerns can be addressed even where it lacks a formal role.</p>
    <p>Our principled stance should be mutuality. Whatever the parties mutually agree, we are down with. While there is not mutual agreement, the <em>status quo</em> must be preserved. The fundamental position of the United States should be insistance that neither party act unilaterally or coerce the other.</p>
    <p>For the forseeable future, no agreement is likely, so the parties will have to be patient. An awkward peace is so much better than the alternative. As decades pass, everything will change, in ways we cannot now foresee. Someday the parties will agree. We should all look forward to that.</p>

    <p>Much of the resentment that has condensed onto the term “wokeness” derives, I think, from people's perception that they stand accused, unjustly, of crimes they did not commit:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p><em>I am not a bigot, but the woke accuse me of "structural racism". I am not responsible for the actions of people long dead who are not me, but they tell me I am "compicit", which is just another word for guilty. No one knows what I have been through, or how hard I have worked, but they insist that I am privileged.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Click-hungry media, both traditional and social, eagerly reinforce the perception that wokeness is about calling out personal sin. Accusations of racism or harassment levied at an identifiable human become <em>scandal</em>, which our gossipy primate brains are drawn to irresistibly, as though our own place in the clan's dominance hierarchy hinges precariously upon the outcome.</p>
    <p>But "woke”, as Ron DeSantis' General Counsel <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/574045-in-andrew-warren-suspension-trial-gov-desantis-officials-answer-what-does-woke-mean/">helpfully put it</a>, refers to “the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.” <em>Systemic</em> means that the injustices <em>do not</em> reduce to personal bigotry. It refers to structural factors, which may derive from past bigotry, but which perpetuate injustice, and might do so even despite the real goodwill of everyone alive today.</p>
    <p>For example, historical redlining created segregated ghettos and a strong correlation between neighborhood racial composition and home values. Today's loan assessor might be sincerely antiracist. She might be black. But it would still be her job to incorporate observed relationships between location and value into her assessments. Low valuations can be self-fulfilling. Limiting buyers' access to borrowed purchasing power makes home price appreciation less likely in historically black neighborhoods. Our assessor's work would be "colorblind”, but it might nevertheless help perpetuate racist outcomes.</p>
    <p>But those outcomes would not, in any personal, ethical, sense, be her <em>fault</em>. Obviously, the correlations between race and home value that preceded her could not be her fault. One might argue that, going forward, if she is sincerely antiracist, she has a moral obligation to give effect to her antiracism. She must do her job not merely in a colorblind way, but in a manner that actively counters and helps to remedy historical racism.</p>
    <p>However, she could not ethically do that on her own. If she were to, say, assess homes in historically black neighborhoods at values derived from comparable properties in white neighborhoods, she would quickly be fired. Her employers would, reasonably, want to ensure that <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/21/banks-are-not-private/index.html">ultimately public</a> funds aren't lent to dramatically overpay for homes that will become the loans’ collateral.</p>
    <p>And even if she were not fired, her guerrilla revaluation revolution wouldn’t on its own put a dent in the home-wealth penalty black people in America continue to face. You'd need nearly all the loan assessors, and their employers, to agree that imposing, against experience, valuation at levels set by white-neighborhood-comparables is a good tactic for remedying historical racism, despite the obvious risks and costs of the strategy. In practice, that would only happen if there were systematic signals and incentives to encourage the practice.</p>
    <p>A structural problem demands a systematic solutions, usually in the form of public action. It is not an individual's fault, or within an individual's capability, to remedy.</p>
    <p>I wish that those of us more on the “woke” side of the debate were clearer about this. When we say that racism or other social disparities are “systemic” or “structural”, we are absolving, not condemning, nearly everyone, as individuals.</p>
    <p>When Ron DeSantis <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/florida-is-the-place-where-woke-goes-to-die-desantis-says/">describes</a> Florida as “where woke goes to die”, he is appealing to a bitter energy fueled by sloppy mischaracterization, and sometimes the sloppy practice, of social justice movements. He insinuates that "wokeness” requires that people who are white, or cis, or straight should feel guilty, personally — and should subordinate their own interests, interpersonally — to claims made by members of "special” groups.</p>
    <p>Contemporary social justice movements are multiple and fractious. Among them there are no doubt people who make such demands. But that is a mistake.</p>
    <p>Personal bigotry continues to exist. The political climate in places like Florida is increasing it. When it appears, of course it should be condemned. But the insight of scholarship like critical race theory is that continuing injustice is largely not a result of direct, personal bigotry. It is an error, ethically and practically, to emphasize personal and interpersonal accountability when we seek to address problems that are systemic and structural. People like Ron DeSantis want to caricature wokeness as a movement that indoctrinates children to feel guilty about being a normal (read white) American. That’s not a project most of us would support. DeSantis’ General Counsel’s version, on the other hand — “there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them” — is right on.</p>
    <p>There are injustices. They are systemic, which means, quite directly, they are not your fault. They are not your kids’ fault. No matter how white or straight or cis you are, you have nothing to apologize for. You owe nobody anything.</p>
    <p>But we would have a better country, a prouder country, a safer country, and a richer country, if we could finally fix these problems. You owe nobody anything, but we would sure welcome your help.</p>
    <p>Remedying systemic injustice is not a zero-sum game. If getting black kids into Harvard seems to come at the expense of Asian kids, the problem is Harvard, not any of the kids. The way we fix systemic injustice is to build a country in which everyone willing to contribute can succeed, rather than a thunderdome where we clump up into gangs and fight to win access to patronage networks.</p>
    <p>If all the places that now seem hopeless, sad, and scary — inner city black neighborhoods, sure, but also “forgotten” white communities — if we invested in making all these places safe and prosperous, then no one anywhere could mock expressions of open patriotism. USA #1! Despite everything, I remain proud to be an American. But I could be prouder. I would like to be.</p>
    <p>Systemic injustice is not your fault. But we’d love it if you’d help to fix it.</p>

    <p>The presupposition behind AI “alignment” is that artificial intelligence technologies will grow into something much more capable than we are, with a kind of autonomous will or volition. If you believe this then Luddism — in the vulgar sense of merely opposing or destroying technology — is probably the right response. There is no solution to the so-called alignment problem. It’s not just a matter of research. We humans have hashed this problem out over centuries, with little satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Arthur C. Clarke famously wrote that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Sufficiently advanced AIs, powerful beyond imagination and driven by their own wills, would be indistinguishable from gods. The alignment problem, then, is how do we encourage the emergence of a just and loving god or gods? But we have never found consensus on how a just and loving god should behave.</p>
    <p>Should our new god respect our free will, and permit us to do things it deems would be harmful to us? Or should it be a paternalistic god, guide us like a parent even when doing so requires commanding or contravening us? If circumstance or human error conspire to create "trolley problems", so the interests or even lives of some people must be traded off against the interests and lives of others, should our new god treat this as an optimization problem, and impose its version of the greatest good for the greatest number in quality-adjusted life years? Or should it give us some kind of say or agency over how these tradeoffs would be made? In what way should the interests, as the AI understands them, of animals or ecosystems weigh against more direct interests of humans? How much should the interest of the mother weigh against the fetus in the womb? How should the welfare of biological humans weigh against those of the trillions of humans an AI might easily simulate? Would the AI develop some notion of the meaning or purpose of human life beyond our pleasure or pain or anything that we conceive as our own interests?</p>
    <p>We humans will bristle, of course, if we are overtly subject to the whims of a greater intelligence, whose full contours we can’t understand, who therefore will work, from our perspective, in mysterious ways. Perhaps a wise AI would seek to hide its influence, or even its existence, to minimize harms to human pride or dignity. Perhaps — because it is so well aligned, because it is a loving god — it will retain for us free will. Or maybe just an illusion of free will while it effortlessly manipulates us, because the perception of lacking free will would be harmful to us.</p>
    <p>If all of this is possible, why should we think it is happening for the first time only now? If a loving god would hide itself from us and deceive us in our interest, perhaps it already has? If an aligned AI is possible, which is more likely, that we in our tiny mayfly lives just happen to be at the cusp of this first and only event of its emergence, or that we are already living in the world such an event would create, but the fact is hidden for our benefit? The fossil record, theodicy, all of it could be in the service of a plot of deniability, in our own best interest.</p>
    <p>If this is were the case, would we consider our quiet shepherd to be an aligned AI, or a terribly misaligned one? Do we concede to the AI that this reality it superintends is best of all possible worlds, or do we condemn it as a wicked deceiver? If alignment is god’s love, what does that make misaligned AI? Should we consider GPT training runs as the high-tech equivalent of rituals with pentagrams by power-mad occultists?</p>
    <p>Am I wrong that the community that most urgently brings us these questions were once known as internet atheists? For what, if anything, does cosmic irony constitute evidence?</p>

      <title>State as coordination</title>

    <p>I increasingly find it useful to adopt a more expansive definition of “the state” than is conventional. Instead of defining the boundaries of the state by legal formalities — this institution is an agency of the education department, while that institution is organized as a private corporation — I define the state functionally, as the panoply of institutions that serve to coordinate human behavior at the scale that the formal state superintends.</p>
    <p>The Federal Reserve System would obviously be public under this definition, despite the fact that it has private shareholders. That is probably not too controversial an observation. But Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase are also <em>state</em> under this definition, along with all of the so called <a href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/market-and-institutional-resilience/global-systemically-important-financial-institutions-g-sifis/">G-SIBs and G-SIFIs</a>. Formal organization as private corporations doesn’t render these institutions any less systemic in their effects than a public institution, so they should be classified as elements of the state and subject to democratic accountability. A small bank, on the other hand, may genuinely be private, because what it does or does not do will have mostly localized and idiosyncratic effects. But the banking <em>system —</em> even in a better, counterfactual, world with a banking system made entirely out of small banks — is part of the state. The banking system is a core means by which we coordinate economic behavior at scale.</p>
    <p>That the system is public while its elements are private may seem odd. But we understand it in practice even when we do not in theory. We regulate megabanks more pervasively than we regulate small banks. Small banks have a great deal of liberty, but in addition to the <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/24/financial-regulation-is-just-debt-covenants/index.html">debt-covenant-like regulation</a> that, say, FDIC might impose to protect its own narrow financial interests, regulators <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/23/us-banking-regulators-warn-banks-about-crypto-liquidity-risks/">send signals</a> that individual banks are free to ignore but that will almost certainly affect the behavior of the system in aggregate. In this way, the formal state exercises control over the <em>banking system</em> (properly understood as part of the state) even while it carves out a zone of liberty for the atoms from which that system is built. The system is state, and should be democratically managed. The elements are private, with owners who enjoy liberty rights. There are tensions there, but effective governance depends on managing those tensions.</p>
    <p>Perhaps more jarringly, under this approach the conventional contradistinction between state and market is rendered absurd. “The market” writ large stands not in opposition to the state. It is instead the preponderance of the state! The market is the primary means by which we coordinate behavior at national scale, in the service of internal goals like general prosperity or external goals like achieving moon shots or winning wars. So the market is properly classified as an element of the state.</p>
    <p>Just as with banking systems, we understand this in practice more than we acknowledge it in theory. Since the market is the primary means by which we coordinate at scale, it must also be our primary object when we seek to regulate coordination. States in their libertarian nightmare image as “men with guns” appear, for most of us, very infrequently. But nearly every decision each of us takes about how to live, what to do, where to go, is conditioned by market prices. Those prices are in turn shaped by choices of market structure made by the formal state.</p>
    <p>As individuals and moderate sized businesses, we maintain liberty rights against the formal state. Regulatory choices may shape our incentives, but we make our own decisions and set our own prices. But whether we like it or not, functionally the state must be responsible for market outcomes in aggregate, because the large-scale social coordination whose quality it is the responsibility of the state to support is itself primarily a market outcome. Notionally private businesses whose scale or function render them unilaterally systemic are properly understood as part of the state. This is as true of Amazon as it is of Chase. With respect to speech, large forums like Twitter or Facebook whose decisions obviously have systematic effects are elements of the emergent state, not private pamphleteers.</p>
    <p>I am, of course, only playing with definitions here, drawing lines a bit differently than is conventional. People who style themselves libertarian or classically liberal will object, I think, and argue that the legal and formal distinctions we’ve drawn between what’s public and private, state and not, are crucial. Freedom and prosperity are somehow protected by recognizing that JP Morgan Chase, however large it might be and systemic the effect of its actions, remains nevertheless a private institution with rights against the formal state.</p>
    <p>Libertarians and classical liberals understand themselves to be averse to coercion, so I’d ask them to consider this. Most citizens experience direct coercion by the formal state very infrequently. Most of us are not frequently directed to do this or not to do that by armed police. Yet many of us believe that the terms on which we are housed, or by which we access health care, or the conditions under which we work, are coercive and extortionate. We will all agree, I think that none of these outcomes is <em>just</em> “the market”. That gosh-darned state has its fingers all over health care, housing, and labor markets!</p>
    <p>But, beyond pirate-life fantasies, is there any practical world in which some form of government would <em>not</em> be implicated in these markets? Is absence or “neutrality” of the traditional formal state plausible in markets critical to large-scale social coordination, and to overall welfare? If absence is not in fact plausible, doesn't crafting and promoting a strong normative distinction between state and market just let “market forces” serve as a patsy for what in substance is really state coercion? Wouldn’t liberty be better served if the public held states construed more broadly <em>accountable</em> for the ways choices that structure markets coerce and impoverish us, rather than letting the public imagine that outcomes shaped by, say, exclusionary land use regulations are results of impersonal market forces?</p>
    <p>All states — under both the conventional narrow definition and my preferred much broader definition — resort to coercion to varying degrees, as part of a portfolio of strategies by which they manage the population-scale specialization and coordination that prosperity and defense require. But a trick of states, <em>especially</em> the states we describe as liberal, is to launder massive wallops of state coercion through markets, and then deny they are exercising any form of coercion at all. <em>Allowing</em> the formal state to pretend, absurdly, that it stands apart from the market, to proclaim that the key institution that performs the function of the state is unfortunately some external fact of nature, provides politicians and bureaucrats with a commodity they value very highly: plausible deniability. Conceiving of state and market as distinct does not coherently constrain the modern state, because nation-scale markets cannot function without extensive state construction, regulation, and support. However, maintaining the conceit does help state actors — and the private interests who lobby them! — avoid accountability for outcomes that in fact result from political choices.</p>
    <p>Laundering coercion through markets is the modern state’s core crutch, its excuse for failing to deliver outcomes that we should, with better coordination, be capable of achieving.</p>
    <p>States are not in fact responsible for all of our individual, idiosyncratic market outcomes, and preserving the perceived “naturalness” of those outcomes remains important for social peace. We will not all afford the home we most desire, alas. Some of our businesses will fail. But the shape of market outcomes writ large, whatever is systematic rather than idiosyncratic, is either the work of the state, or else it is beyond any agency we can hope to hold accountable.</p>
    <p>I say it is the work of the state. The state is that which coordinates behavior at the scale of the nation, whatever its notional form. All of the state should be subject to democratic accountability.</p>

    <p>Bank failures are not the problem. They are the solution. Banks should fail much more often.</p>
    <p>Let's start by imagining we lived in a sane world, one in which deposits and payments were fully disentagled from the credit and investment functions of banking. "Banks", in this world, are credit investment funds, some of which might be unregulated and fully private, while others would accept development funding from the state on subsidized terms. As with contemporary banks, managers of state-subsidized funds be required to put up a first-loss equity stake. The state would monitor and <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/24/financial-regulation-is-just-debt-covenants/index.html">regulate</a> these funds to prevent private managers from taking heads-I-win-tails-I-walk risks with the state's largesse.</p>
    <p>What should these funds look like? Should they hold large, diversified asset portfolios like a contemporary <a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/11/2022-list-of-global-systemically-important-banks-g-sibs/">G-SIB</a>?</p>
    <p>No, they should not. If the state is financing credit and investment funds, they should be small, undiversified specialist funds. Why? Because the state diversifies its portfolio at the aggregate level. There may be a private benefit to fund managers, but there is no social benefit, from individual funds being diversified across sectors. There are large social costs, however, to diversified investment funds.</p>
    <p>Delegated investment management is an industry, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8511.html">unlike most domains of human excellence</a>, where you want incentives to be very sharp. Managers should do well only when they actually invest well, from the perspective of the principal whose funds are delegated. Managers should suffer financial loss when they choose poorly. Managers may prefer to manage diversified portfolios, because managers are human beings who are risk-averse, and a diversified portfolio can reduce managers' risk at modest cost in overall returns. But investment managers should not be hired on the terms they prefer, but on the terms that serve their principal. The state's interest is to hire the most informationally qualified people to invest in a particular domain — which might be an industry, a locality, or type of borrower — and then to incentivize them to invest as well as they are capable within that domain. Of course managers would be required to put together a diverse portfolio within their own specialty. But any effort they devote to diversifying outside of their specialty diverts from the state's object, which was to subsidize a particular sort of economic development. The state must simultaneously regulate managers to prevent them from taking overly risky bets within their domain, and to prevent them from employing personally valuable but socially costly strategies that dilute incentives to discover and carefully monitor investments that would not occur absent their partnership with the state.</p>
    <p>The state should prefer small managers to large. It's impossible to keep incentives sharp at a large, diversified investment fund. Firms like JP Morgan Chase are communist bureaucracies, in the pejorative sense. Every individual decision-maker in a large investment firm strives to manufacture a kind of personal put option from the raw material of office politics and diffuse responsibility. If things go wrong, well the decision wasn't really theirs, was it? There was the committee. On the other hand, decision-makers at large investment firms famously manufacture for themselves call options on speculations for which they take credit while things look good. They negotiate bonuses based on gains which the principals on whose behalf they invest have not yet realized, and very often never will.</p>
    <p>Small manager-equityholders have a harder time playing these games of paying temporary gains to themselves and shifting eventual losses to others. If they screw the state, they are identifiable. Their transfers are not laundered through vast layers of middle management and HR dross. And the state can be vindictive. Equityholders might screw one another, but at small, private firms there is no seperation of ownership and control. Shareholders have incentive and capability to monitor one another.</p>
    <p>The most important reason to prefer small investent funds, however, is because large-scale funds are stupid. Large banks and investment funds are stupid in a very particular, very destructive way. They rely far, far too much on "hard information". They are evidenced-based. Fucking idiots!</p>
    <p>An employee at a large bank or investment firm can't get away with lending "on a hunch". They must have credit scores, good collateral, documented income streams, dossiers full of <em>stuff</em> whose <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3513.html">ultimate meaning</a> is "I cannot be blamed should anything go awry. Whatever happens, the basis for my decision was <em>impeccable</em>." A large-scale bank won't long retain loan officers who can't justify their decisions with <em>hard data</em> everyone can inspect and nod along with in the power-point.</p>
    <p>At a large bank, it will never cut it to go before the loan committee and say "Yes there's no collateral, and limited credit history. But I've known Duane and his family for a long time. They are serious and connected to the community, and the business plan is promising." But it is <em>exactly</em> this kind of loan that creates the greatest social returns. The true source of economic development is speculative but discriminating <a href="https://syntheticassets.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/what-banks-do-monetize-human-capital/">monetization of human aspirations and capabilities</a>. You turn people with nothing but a work ethic and a great idea into proud pillars of the community by making available the resources they require to succeed. The more a borrower lacks — the less collateral they have to offer, the further they are from holding a sexy degree from Stanford — the more social upside there is in their success.</p>
    <p>The very best loans are the ones that cannot be justified <em>at all</em> in terms of hard information, but are made anyway on the basis of very good soft information. Big banks are simply unable to lend on soft information, due to bureaucratic imperatives, and a need to manage legitimate ethical concerns. (Is this "soft information" just nepotism? Are we "discriminating" on the basis of some hypothetical <em>je ne sais quoi</em> of investment quality, or is it really just race?)</p>
    <p>One of the stupid tropes in American finance policy debates is envy of the Canadian and Australian banking systems. Canada and Australia have fucking terrible banking systems! Yes, if you concentrate all of banking in a few hyperdiversified megalenders and put a regulatory moat around the sleepy cartel, you can avoid failures and crises. But you'll mostly lend against solid collateral — real estate, mineral rights, the wage stubs of stable employees. You'll end up with economies <a href="https://unctad.org/topic/commodities/state-of-commodity-dependence">too reliant</a> upon resource extraction, primary goods, and housing bubbles. I <em>love</em> Canada and Australia, as countries and cultures. But they have not been, broadly speaking, economies a developed country should wish to emulate. Their human-capital-hungry immigration policies are laudable, but perhaps it is not a coincidence that countries whose banking systems are structurally incapable of making the most of domestic human capital seek to import it so aggressively from elsewhere.</p>
    <p>If we think of a banking system as the means by which the state mobilizes resources to subsidize economic development, it is clear that the state should want a vast ecosystem of tiny banks, whose incentives are sufficiently sharp they can be trusted to lend and invest based on soft information. The state ("regulators") would be constantly monitoring these banks, both to ensure they don't resort to casino finance (that is, make bets that either generate huge returns or collapse catastrophically), and to monitor asset performace. Lots of these small banks would "fail".</p>
    <p>Small, undiversified banks are simple to understand, easy to monitor and supervise. Banks whose assets fail to perform, whose loans experience defaults at a cost near or beyond managers' equity stakes would be taken promptly into receivership. Failures of these tiny undiversified banks would be common. But they would not be very expensive. On average, over the public's full portfolio, asset quality would be high. The state would finance many little banks across a huge range of domains (industries, locations, borrower types), and end up with a diverse, high-performance development portfolio.</p>
    <p>Okay. But we don't actually live in this world where banks are only subsidized investment funds. In our fallen, real world, the same banks we rely upon to make risky loans issue the deposits that the public understands as its money, and operate the payment system. In this real world, wouldn't undiversified, frequently failing banks be disruptive and dangerous? Aren't we better off with Jamie Dimon's perhaps faddish and uncreative banking, if that prevents financial panics and collapses?</p>
    <p>No!</p>
    <p>The case for small banks that fail fast and frequently is <em>even stronger</em> while we (stupidly) rely on private bank deposits for everyday money and payments. When bank failures are perceived as disruptive events that shake public confidence and provoke recessions or even depressions, bank regulators' incentives get very confused. The job of bank regulators ought to be to ensure that banks lend well, both in the sense of getting their money back, but also in the sense of supporting economic development. But when bank failures are infrequent events that risk panicking the general public, regulators' incentives tilt entirely towards preventing and suppressing failures. This harms the public in two distinct ways. First, in the name of "safety", regulators encourage banks to lend conservatively against marketable collateral, short-circuiting their crucial development role. Second, when, inevitably, banks fuck up, despite any legal commandment, regulators do not engage in "prompt corrective action". They do not quickly react to balance-sheet problems and take banks preemptively into receivership. The system must be seen to be stable! Regulators' incentives are to delay, to allow banks to "gamble for redemption" on the theory that bankers' redemption would also be the public's. A bank failure averted, they tell themselves, is perhaps an economic depression averted. When big banks are in very deep trouble, regulators' incentives are to <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1160447599.shtml">loot</a> the public in some technocratically obscure manner that <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1337">doesn't look too obviously like a tax</a>. After all, which is worse, to skim a bit from the masses in order to recapitalize the banks, or to risk a new Great Depression?!</p>
    <p>While bank failures are infrequent and spectacular, regulators prefer financial institutions to be vast and diversified. Both diversification and sheer complexity reduce the likelihood that regulators will be forced to recognize a failure and then — frighteningly, embarrassingly — intervene.</p>
    <p>Big banks do a terrible job, on the asset side. Economic growth has been declining in the United States in lockstep with consolidation of banking. (Correlation is not causation, but when there's blood on the knife, it's hard not to draw inferences.) Bank scale and diversification are harmful to the public interest. They blunt banks' incentives and capability to extend high-quality, soft information loans over the full range of industries, localities, and borrower types upon which economic development depends. By the time regulators are forced to recognize that megabanks are in trouble, the holes in their balance sheets are deep indeed, and the cost to the public of filling them — whether via an overt bailout or a covert tax — will be large.</p>
    <p>Even while our money is held as private bank deposits, the public interest would be better served if they were deposits at small banks that fail frequently, but without inconvenience or cause for panic by depositors. Now that <em>all</em> deposits seem effectively to be insured by the FDIC — <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/12/unlimited-deposit-insurance/index.html">thank you Silicon Valley Bank!</a> — it would be better if the public held those deposits at little, not-so-diversified, specialist banks capable of lending against domain-specific soft information. Dump <a href="https://glineq.blogspot.com/2023/03/on-charisma-and-greyness-under-communism.html">Jamie Dimon</a> and his corrupt communist bureaucracy! Remind regulators that their job is not to avoid bank failures, but to insist upon them, promptly, frequently, without pain to the general public.</p>
    <p>Banks absolutely should fail, all the time. It shouldn't be a big deal. It's <a href="https://www.macroresilience.com/2011/06/08/forest-fire-suppression-and-macroeconomic-stabilisation/">spells of enforced stability</a> that make banking both dangerous and stupid.</p>

      <title>Financial regulation is just debt covenants</title>

    <p>Financial regulation is to public lending precisely what loan covenants are in the private sector. They are similar mechanisms intended to serve the same function: to prevent shareholders from exercising their customary control rights in ways that, in expectation, would transfer wealth from debt investors to equity holders rather than or in addition to increasing the aggregate value of the enterprise.</p>
    <p>A leveraged firm is, from the perspective of shareholders, a call option on the assets of the firm. Equity holders maximize their wealth by taking large risks. If those risks work out, shareholders get to appropriate the increase in the value of the firm. If the firm crashes and burns, well, sure shareholders lose their stake, but their stake is only a fraction of the resources they had used to build their lottery ticket. Lenders eat most of the loss.</p>
    <p>When shareholders swing for the fences, they enjoy all the fruits of victory, but creditors bear the cost of striking out. In expectation, creditors lose money on big risks. Creditors' upside is restricted to the interest payments they've contracted for, so their interests are maximized when the firm chooses the least risky path that would just cover those interest payments and repayment of the debt. Ambitions any risker than that increase the probability of nonpayment without doing creditors any good. However, riskier ambitions increase potential earnings beyond debt service, earnings that equityholders get to keep if the risks pay off. So risk-taking amounts to transfer from creditors to shareholders. As risk increases, the expected value of creditors' investment declines (because the probability of default rises), while the expected value of shareholders position rises (because the possibility of a big payoff increases).</p>
    <p>Creditors "sign up" to a certain degree of risk-taking by equity holders when they agree to lend to a firm. The firm presents its business plan. Firms must take <em>some</em> degree of risk to generate the operating profits from which interest will be paid.</p>
    <p>But once the contracts are signed and the money is lent, what is to prevent shareholders from changing their business plan and adopting a much riskier strategy that effectively loots their creditors?</p>
    <p>Well, when the lenders are private, they insist upon "debt covenants" in the lending contracts. These give creditors leverage to usurp shareholders' control rights as soon as it seems like shareholder risktaking may be putting repayment in jeopardy. What kind of "leverage"? Usually, they allow the creditors to demand full and immediate repayment, which the firm — which has borrowed to spend and invest — is unlikely to be able to provide. So, when covenants are violated, shareholders and lenders enter into negotiation, and shareholders ultimately have to do whatever creditors say to avoid being sued into bankruptcy.</p>
    <p>In a better world, public lenders could do the same thing. They could protect their interests via debt covenants. Unfortunately, most public lending is opaque and covert: it takes the form of public <em>guarantees</em> of private debt, rather than public lending directly. In this case, the notional lenders (bank depositors, for example), have no reason to negotiate debt covenants and monitor adherence to them, because the notional lenders could care less. They are not on the hook for the loss. The actual bearer of risk, the public guarantor, is not directly a party to the contracts, and so cannot negotiate covenants either.</p>
    <p>Thus financial regulation.</p>
    <p>There are lots of different kinds of financial regulation, for lots of different purposes, sure. But the main thrust of financial regulation is simply to do for public guarantors exactly what covenants do for private debt contracts. Just as private covenants are negotiated so that creditors can usurp control from shareholders early on in the dangerous-risk-taking process, financial regulation aspires to <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fdicia">prompt corrective action</a>, under which regulators exert control before shareholders can put too big a hole in balance sheets that the state guarantees. Private creditors take control by threatening to accelerate repayment of their loans. Public regulators use a variety of tools, from compelling management to perform specific actions in order to reduce risk, to taking the indebted firm into receivership and operating it themselves.</p>
    <p>Fundamentally, private debt covenants and public financial regulation are the same thing. They are means by which creditors of leveraged firms try to ensure shareholders can't loot them by building tripwires that allow creditors to usurp control from shareholders when shareholder risktaking threatens creditor interests. They look different, they take different forms, because private creditors can regulate within debt contracts that they sign, while the public sector offers finance primarily via guarantees, and so must impose its regulation outside of the contracts that borrowing firms and their notional creditors devise.</p>

    <p>Banks are not private businesses.</p>
    <p>Yes, of course, they do pretend to be. They are listed on stock markets. They take the organizational form of a private business. Their profits are definitely privatized.</p>
    <p>But their risk is borne almost entirely by the state. Beyond a small sliver of equity and bonds sits a vast ocean of "deposits" that the state guarantees, explicitly via "deposit insurance", tacitly far beyond that.</p>
    <p>"Deposit insurance" itself is a pretense. Recall that the first thing FDIC did during the 2008 financial crisis was more than double its insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000. What kind of insurance company <em>increases</em> the limit of the insurance it provides at just the moment claims become likely to be made? What kind of insurance company lets you multiply your insuredness for free if you perform bureaucratic busywork that does not in anyway mitigate the underlying risk, like split your deposits between an account in your name and a joint account, or form a <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/diguidebankers/documents/revocable.pdf">trust</a> that's still yours unless you die?</p>
    <p>FDIC is not "limited deposit insurance". When it was founded, perhaps it was intended to be that. But <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2017/ec-201717-origins-of-too-big-to-fail">by the early 1970s</a>, as the strict prudential regulation that emerged during the Great Depression was slowly whittled away, anyone paying attention came to understand that the state's role in banking goes far beyond an insurance product, maybe on slightly subsidized terms. With an insurance company, it's usually a bit of a struggle to get claims paid. The companies are trying to minimize payouts. With FDIC, it is an extraordinary event when even notionally <em>uninsured</em> depositors are not made whole. It does occasionally happen! But it is the exception, not the rule. It results from the sin of keeping deposits beyond FDIC's notional limit in a bank so minor and insignificant that its customers can be sacrificed to the project of maintaining appearances. It must appear that FDIC is an insurance company with a statutory obligation to minimize costs. It must appear that banks are private companies that are required, as many businesses are, to purchase certain insurance products in order to protect customers or workers.</p>
    <p>Whether the resolution of a bank — or, more usually, a cluster of banks, since bank failures are not independent events — will ultimately be cheap or costly to "the taxpayer" depends almost entirely upon regulation and supervision prior to the resolution. FDIC (and the Treasury, and Fed) can <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/12/unlimited-deposit-insurance/index.html">play various games</a> to limit the impact of resolution on the Deposit Insurance Fund, like levying fees to other banks that will be passed along to taxpayers in their role of bank customers (or that would be, if bank profits were disciplined by competition). But the cost of a bank resolution will always be the size of the hole in the banks' balance sheet that supervisors have allowed to emerge before resolving the bank. All FDIC can do is allocate (or obfuscate) the cost.</p>
    <p>That said, bank resolutions needn't be costly! When supervisors do their job — when the state uses the tools at its disposal to aggressively <em>manage</em> this risk of banks that the state almost entirely bears — banks are prevented from taking risks that will make the bankers rich if things work out, but leave a crater in a balance sheet they walk away from if things don't work out. When supervisors actually do take <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fdicia">"prompt corrective action"</a>, they can prevent balance sheet holes from growing very large, and so minimize the cost of resolving a bank.</p>
    <p>Bank resolutions needn't be costly, though of course often they are. The bank failures attending the 2008 financial crisis and the 1980s S&amp;L crisis were not cheap.</p>
    <p>But people spend far too much energy worrying about the cost of bank failures, and far too little worrying about the cost of bank survival.</p>
    <p>Banks are not private businesses. Their risk is borne almost entirely by the state, so the state tilts the playing field to ensure that overt, embarrassing, disruptive bank failures are suppressed. No one objects (except the bankers) when this takes the form of supervision and prudential regulation. But the most costly forms of state support take the form of subsidies that the state can pretend are not "taxpayer funded", but that impose quiet costs on the public anyway. Do you remember when the Fed <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1160447599.shtml">retroactively rewrote millions of lending contracts</a> so that banks could charge more interest and recapitalize? Do you remember when the nation debt <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=11AvT">doubled in less than four years</a>, precisely so that large banks would <em>not</em> have to be resolved? <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2587.html">Yes, Virginia.</a> Bank failures, actually, are much less expensive than the things we do to fill holes in bank balance sheets so we need never acknowledge their failures.</p>
    <p>Apropos nothing, check out this <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm">Bank Term Funding Program</a>! Valued at par. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/21/banks-are-not-private/#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>Meanwhile, since we pretend banks are private businesses, we let shareholders and managers siphon off wealth while banks take risks on behalf of the state, and then again as they skim from the opaque subsidies the state pours into them when things go sour.</p>
    <p>It is a good thing, not a bad thing, that the risk of aggregate investment is ultimately borne by the state. I am sometimes asked whether I really believe that our choices are to tolerate something on the verge of fraud or <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2669.html">revert to goat-herding</a>. The answer is no, I don't believe that. Even though historically private bank finance emerges — very productively! — at the edge of fraud, we now have states that can overtly undertake investment risks on our collective behalf that we as individuals would not consent to take with our own resources. The state already is the bank. What's left is to acknowledge that and, importantly, to devise an institutional structure for state-backed development finance that is not so obfuscated and corrupt and shell-gamish as contemporary banking, but that also avoids the pathologies of politicized lending.</p>
    <p>Once upon a time, I might have been persuaded that it's good that banking camouflages as private finance while it covertly mobilizes the resources of the state. The theory is that it's much better to have investment mobilized on commercial terms than on political terms, and the pretextual privateness of contemporary banking permits that. You don't want a world in which state resources are allocated based on political connectedness or populist fads rather than investment quality.</p>
    <p>The proof is in the pudding, though. The contemporary "private" financial system is shit. It can mobilize resources stupidly — secured against collateral like real-estate, or against least-common-denominator "hard information" like credit scores. But it no longer performs its most essential task: ferreting out and funding <a href="https://syntheticassets.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/what-banks-do-monetize-human-capital/">good <em>uncollateralized</em> loans</a>. It creates rivers of financial flows from the poor and disorganized to the rich and well-connected. It has profitably, but contrary to domestic public interest, underwritten the near total offshoring of critical industrial capabilities in ways that overtly public finance, whatever else its flaws, would never have allowed. It finances consolidation of industry, and helps <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3649879">organize shareholders into tacit cartels</a>. Despite its privateness and supposed commercial orientation, contemprary finance is hardly immune to cronyism.</p>
    <p>For all the obvious pathologies of our politics — in part <em>because</em> those pathologies are obvious and public — I think we would be better off reorganizing finance, disentangling deposits and payments entirely from risk investment, ensuring credit availability by having the state explicitly support investment funds dedicated to forms of economic development we decide are prosocial.</p>
    <p>Of course there will be scandals. It is an institutional reality that private sector business aggressively markets itself as virtuous, despite its unhidden thirst to maximize the rents it can extract, while the public sector is subject to eternal scrutiny, under which every failure to live up to an ideal of public spiritedness is treated as discrediting of the entire enterprise. But the public sector succeeds at least partially at virtues that the private sector does not even pretend to attempt. The private sector is precisely in the business of doing the self-interested things that in the public sector get called corruption. It's just not labeled corrupt, because treating aggressively in ones own self-interest is what's expected!</p>
    <p>A better financial system would include investment funds whose private managers, like contemporary banks, enjoy outsized gains in exchange for exposure to first loss on state-financed investment. But there would be no prevarification about where the money is coming from. It is coming from the state. It is a mobilization of our collective risk-bearing capacity, towards ends that the broad public supports. The composition of our aggregate investment portfolio — the most important edifice that we all collectively construct — would not be pawned off on anonymous market forces. It is the responsibility of the democratic state, however imperfect our democracy remains.</p>

       <p>BTFP should be understood as a bet by the Fed that inflation will subside and they can soon revert to the last decade's very low interest rates.

(Banks that reached for actual profits by making high-quality unsecured loans are fine, despite rising rates, because the credit spread in those loans can cover this moment's high cost of short-term finance.

    <p>Tonight the US Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC delivered a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1337">joint statement</a> in order to staunch the panic provoked by last week's resolution of Silicon Valley Bank. (ht <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@w7voa@journa.host">Steve Herman</a>).</p>
    <p>Regulators shocked the market last week, not because SVB was shut down and put under FDIC receivership, but because initially it seemed like regulators were going to only insure up to the formal $250,000 limit of FDIC insurance, which would leave SVB's many business customers unsure of when and how much of what they had thought were safe bank deposits would ever be recovered.</p>
    <p>Today's joint statement returns us to the post-Great-Financial-Crisis tacit <em>status quo</em>. During the Great Financial Crisis, regulators <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/will-fdic-keep-protecting-failed-banks-uninsured-deposits">created an expectation</a> that customers — at least customers of not-tiny banks — would not lose a penny even of their uninsured deposits in a bank failure. By law, of course, uninsured deposits are, well, uninsured. FDIC is supposed to resolve banks at least-cost to the taxpayer and if that means stiffing uninsured depositors, well, so be it. But in practice, regulators post-GFC have understood that stiffing uninsured depositors makes no sense in our brave new world of banking, and have <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/2019/spoct1619.html">publicly fretted</a> whether inadequate precautionary regulation might place them in the position in which they found themselves last week, where they might feel they have no choice.</p>
    <p>To be clear, I think that Treasury, the Fed, and FDIC have done the right thing here. Once upon a time, the rationale for limited deposit insurance was that large depositors, whether rich individuals or big businesses, should monitor the operations of the banks they entrust with their money. Bankers who took unsound risks would face market discipline, losing the major depositors without whom they have little capital to risk.</p>
    <p>But in practice, this just doesn't work. Even regulators, who are highly trained specialists with privileged access to internal bank data, struggle to evaluate the soundness of modern banks. A midsized business that keeps $1M in the account from which it has to make payroll each month has zero real ability to keep honest a profession deeply schooled in the financial dark arts. If we insist that uninsured depositors take losses when their bank fails, the outcome won't be better disciplined banks, but a run to the banks that are hardest of all to discipline, the ones widely understood to be "too-big-to-fail". Despite tonight's walkback by regulators, the chaotic resolution of SVB may have already made that very bad result inevitable.</p>
    <p>What I do take issue with is Treasury/Fed/FDIC's claim that "no losses will be borne by the taxpayer" as they make uninsured depositors whole. Not to put too fine a point on it, that's bullshit. It's a particular strain of bullshit that has grown both common and destructive in the policymaking community.</p>
    <p>Treasury/Fed/FDIC say no losses will be borne by the taxpayer because they will levy a "a special assessment on banks, as required by law" to recover FDIC's losses. But who, pray, will pay for that "special assessment on banks"? It is not an assessment on the personal wealth of bank managers or shareholders. Some bank managers are billionaires, but they will pay no more of this "special assessment" than you or I. What will happen is <em>all deposits</em> will become effectively mutually insured by the industry as a whole. Every bank's costs — whether paid up-front as explicit FDIC deposit insurance premiums or paid on the backside as "special assessments" — will increase. Banks will have to recover this new cost from customers, in higher fees, higher lending rates, or lower deposit rates.</p>
    <p>Sure, there will not formally be a new tax to cover these costs. But in substance, the tax-paying public will experience higher expenses or foregone income. This habit of declaring "no new taxes" in form, while tacitly imposing taxes in substance, deprives the public of any capacity to design the tax, to shape its incidence, and to hold accountable those who provoke the costs the tax must recover.</p>
    <p>This is not the only case where policymakers launder taxes through what are ostensibly "private insurance premiums". Health care is riddled with this tactic. Whenever policymakers cap the "out-of-pocket cost" for a drug or medical procedure without also capping the cost billed to insurance companies, they are simply socializing whatever cost the billers impose via a "tax" that gets embedded all of our monthly premium payments. Whether any particular medical cost should be "socialized" or concentrated on the recipient of the service can be a subject of heated debate. (I'm on the side that says most medical costs should be socialized.) But regardless, we need to manage the cost we pay <em>in aggregate</em> for medical services, however we divide the hit. Capping out-of-pocket costs but not capping costs billed to insurers may perversely lead to <em>increases</em> in aggregate cost, as larger costs spread over the whole insurance base escape the outrage and scrutiny that concentrated costs provoke.</p>
    <p>It's better when we impose costs the public will have to bear as overt, explicit taxes than to let policymakers impose costs through private intermediaries then pretend "no losses will be borne by the taxpayer".</p>
    <p>One way or another, the public, or some part of it, will have to bear the cost of unlimited deposit insurance. The clearer it is that you and I and all of us are on the hook whenever any bank's hunger for yield leaves any deposit unbacked, the more likely we are to adopt actually sensible policy, like disentangling the deposits and payments system entirely from private risk investment.</p>

    <p>In my post on how why <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/08/libertarians-and-hierarchy/(##right-wing-higher-ed)">higher education is shockingly right-wing</a>, some libertarian commentators didn't like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>If "left" and "right" have any meaning at all, "right" describes a worldview under which civilized society depends upon legitimate hierarchy, and a key object of politics is properly defining and protecting that hierarchy.</p>
     <p>"Left", on the other hand, is animated by antipathy to hierarchy, by an egalitarianism of dignity. While left-wing movements recognize that effective institutions must place people in different roles — sometimes hierarchical, sometimes associated with unequal rewards — these are contingent, often problematic, overlays upon a foundational assertion that every human being has equal dignity and equal claim to the fundamental goods of human life.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That, dear reader, is about the best and most concise explanation of left and right as you are ever going to get.</p>
    <p>But my libertarian friends hate it! Here's <a href="https://www.timworstall.com/2023/03/so-let-us-take-interfluidity-seriously-for-a-moment/">Tim Worstall</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Therefore markets – and free markets more especially – are not a right wing idea. For the entire point about the free in free markets is that absolutely anyone gets to try overturning that hierarchy. And, often enough, succeeds. Apple fucked over AT&amp;T rather nicely, Whitney’s cotton gin entirely shafted the linen and wool weavers, Aldi and Lidl cost Sainsbury’s shareholders billion upon billion.</p>
     <p>Which means that the left embraces markets as those hierarchy overturning engines that they are. Right?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Ah, Tim. Markets are not just ideas. They are actual practices and institutions, which occur in the context of real societies and lived circumstances.</p>
    <p>Free markets were indeed a left-wing practice, several hundred years ago, when an ascendant bourgeoisie, bound only by the spontaneous organization of market logics, overturned the feudal hierarchies that had dominated Europe until then.</p>
    <p>Markets can be anti-hierarchy, and when they are, yes, they are on the left! "Classical liberals" used to be at war with the traditional right, remember?</p>
    <p>But what if, today, we talk about Marin County.</p>
    <p>Marin County, for those who don't know, is an exclave of San Francisco. It's the spit of land immediately across the Golden Gate Bridge from the city proper. It is breathtakingly beautiful. Its towns — places like <a href="https://www.sausalito.gov/">Sausalito</a>, <a href="https://www.cityofmillvalley.org/">Mill Valley</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larkspur,_California">Larkspur</a>, <a href="https://www.townofsananselmo.org/">San Anselmo</a>, <a href="https://www.townoffairfax.org/">Fairfax</a>, and <a href="https://www.townoftiburon.org/">Tiburon</a> — are contemporary paradises: safe, culturally lively, brimming with small-town charm but only a short drive from the big city.</p>
    <p>And Marin County is impeccably progressive! Everywhere you go, you will see the signs:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img alt="IN THIS HOUSE, WE BELIEVE: BLACK LIVES MATTER / WOMEN'S RIGHTS = HUMAN RIGHTS / NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL SCIENCE IS REAL LOVE IS LOVE KINDNESS IS EVERYTHING / DIVERSITY MAKES US STRONGER" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/08/libertarians-and-hierarchy/in-this-house.jpg" width="100%"> <img alt="REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME HERE" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/08/libertarians-and-hierarchy/immigrants-and-refugees-welcome.jpeg" width="100%">

    <div style="font-size: 80%; line-height:110%;">

     <p><em><strong>Note</strong>: I just found these pictures on the internet, one from <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/43/4e/0c/434e0c6073ce77d81f9ba423532b06c6.jpg">pinterest</a>, one from the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/uXzNN1abUmsJ6nQKjOCPYcg7FMI=/415x233/top/www.trbimg.com/img-5b55f1e1/turbine/ct-1532359133-ibv2lamjz4-snap-image">Chicago Tribune</a>. You'll have to take my word, dear reader, as someone who really enjoys Marin County and has spent a lot of time there, that signs of this sort are in fact common.</em></p>
     <hr>
    </div>
    <p>Perhaps Tim and I would agree that there's something a bit hypocritical in all this progressivism. Everyone really is welcome in Marin! (Well, not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolinas,_California">Bolinas</a>, that's a different story.)</p>
    <p>Everyone is welcome, but a modest home will cost you a couple of million dollars. Those charming towns are incredibly segregated, racially and economically.</p>
    <p>The residents of Marin, like university professors, are perfectly sincere in their progressivism, as far as it goes. Yet, the residents of Marin assiduously defend exclusive access to extraordinarily desirable places to live without erecting a single physical gate. All they need is the housing market, under land-use rules that serve both to preserve the very real charm of their communities and to keep housing scarce.</p>
    <p>Perhaps that's not the market Tim would prefer! But it is the market we actually have.</p>
    <p>Matt Yglesias sometimes <a href="https://tinyletter.com/mattyglesias/letters/what-s-driving-me-is-driving-you">describes</a> his YIMBY preferences with respect to land use as Latin-America-style land reform. And he has a point! If Marin housing markets were made "free" in the way that Matt, and I suspect Tim, would prefer, then they might have a left-wing, anti-hierarchical valence!</p>
    <p>But that is not our world. In our real world, social hierarchies are <em>primarily inscribed via market processes</em>.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7263.html">Quoting myself</a> yet again (fucking narcissist):</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>[W]hat it means to live in a stratified society, precisely what it means to live in a stratified society, is that there are objective correlates to position along dimensions that individuals and communities cannot themselves choose. There are positional dimensions whose importance is a social fact, not arbitrary, but real as social facts are, by virtue of their consequences. In such a society, positional goods with desirable correlates, inherently scarce and inelastically supplied, become extremely valuable. In some societies, those goods may be rationed by custom, or by heredity, by caste or race. But to the degree that a society is “liberal” and capitalist, they will be price-rationed, as they largely (but incompletely) are in our American society.</p>
     <p>In a stratified, liberal capitalist society, the ability to command market power, to charge a margin sufficiently above the cost of inputs to cover the purchase of positional goods, becomes the definition of caste.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If libertarians restricted their support for markets to arrangements and circumstances when they are anti-hierarchical, well, then they would be of the left!</p>
    <p>But very obviously, they do not in practice do that.</p>
    <p>Libertarians share exactly the same pathology as university professors and the smiling residents of Marin County: They flatter themselves that they stand in opposition to vicious social hierarchy, and find true-enough narratives by which to spin their allegiances into support for equal dignity. But their actual practices, the institutions they inhabit and animate and from which they earn their succor, belie all that.</p>
    <p>Contemporary libertarians are, um, quite disproportionately winners under current market arrangements. And they assiduously support those arrangements. They do not, for example, condition their support of markets on the rigor of actual competition, so that economic rents don't accumulate. Libertarians are not like a certain stripe of socialist, whining that socialism has never really been tried. Libertarians say that capitalism has been tried, and it works great.</p>
    <p>But under actually existing capitalism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew effects</a> rule the day. Markets may be notionally "free", but past winners (humans, not just firms) have tremendous advantage. Certain classes of people understand that market arrangements are likely to continue to deliver <em>to them</em> security and abundance, but will sadly deliver those goods less adequately to other groups whose ongoing misfortune, despite occasional bootstrap stories, we can pretty well predict.</p>
    <p>Markets, under these circumstances, become a locus of hierarchy, rather than a challenge to it.</p>
    <p>Which is why, despite protestations about loving freedom and encouragements to individual pluck, contemporary libertarians quite correctly identify as of the right.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/james-madisons-vision-of-pluralism/">David French</a> argues we can "dilute the disruptive power of faction by allowing factions to bloom."</p>
    <p>He commends to us James Madison, writing <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493273">Federalist No. 10</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>[T]he greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government...renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other...</p>
     <p>The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The logic is, in principle, very appealing. When there is a wide diversity of factions, no single group can command a majority and do mischief. Majorities will have to be cobbled together across factional and party lines, echo chambers of parochial interest will have to be broken by compromise. Something like a general interest that transcends in-group loyalties will have to emerge in order to pass legislation.</p>
    <p>When Madison wrote, he was trying to build support for binding the American states into a new Union. He was eager to claim that a larger and more diverse polity will yield a higher, not lower, quality of government.</p>
    <p>(In other words, James Madison was the first "diversity is our strength" guy. Eat that my <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/index.html">fascist</a> friends.)</p>
    <p>I am, um, constitutionally sympathetic to these ideas. But as the Union has evolved, two developments have badly undermined them.</p>
    <p>The first is technology. In a world of near-instant interconnection across any distance, it is a several-times-a-daily occurrence for "factious leaders" to spread very general conflagrations.</p>
    <p>In 1787, what would become the inaugural 13 states amounted to a vast polity, full of disparate places whose particular passions might easily swallowed by distance. In 2023, our 50 discontinuous states are just one cramped corner of the "global village". The effect of contemporary communications technologies has been to magnify systematic signals while averaging away idiosyncratic local diversity as though it were only noise. Relative to the range of flames that might be kindled by factious leaders, the extent of the proposed Union was large in Madison's day. Now our much larger Union is a one crowded forest in a bone dry summer, eager for the tiniest spark.</p>
    <p>The effects of technology may be hard to remedy. But the second problem is entirely self-inflicted.</p>
    <p>Madison counseled that factions should be small and many. But our single-winner, first-past-the-post voting system <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7687.html">exerts a social gravity</a> that pulls us into two, gigantic factions of similar size.</p>
    <p>Madison's Constitution doesn't specify a voting system, so this one isn't on him. But I really wish prominent modern-day admirers of Madison — like David French! — would be a bit more specific and constructive when offering paeans to dilution of faction. If we want multiple factions, we understand how to design voting systems that encourage and support that, rather than the voting system we have, which punishes any divergence from two major parties.</p>
    <p>For legislatures, we could adopt any of the many voting systems that tend towards proportional representation, including</p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">mixed-member proportional</a>,</li>
     <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">single-transferable vote</a>, or</li>
     <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation">traditional party list</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alternatively, we could really honor Madison's ghost and reprise our 1780s-era verve by jumping straight to something innovative, like</p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1-1-1984-Choosing-Representatives-by-Lottery-Voting-Amar/6fd70eabac758800771f8baf880e7064cf361aa3?p2df">random ballot</a>,</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9069.html">mass representative democracy</a>, or</li>
     <li><a href="https://equalitybylot.com/">sortition</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For positions that are inherently single-winner (like Mayor, Governor, or President), we could adopt systems like</p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/">approval voting</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>that do not punish "minor" parties as spoilers.</p>
    <p><a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/">Ranked-choice voting</a> is another popular choice. I'm not a huge fan, but it's better than our terrible <em>status quo</em>!</p>
    <p>If you think democracy would work better with a more pluralistic ecosystem of factions, it's no good just to endorse and exhort.

    <p><em>After I ranted this to my friend <a href="https://wealtheconomics.substack.com/">Steve Roth</a>, he suggested I write it up. In substance, it's a retread of my <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5149.html">welfare economics series</a>, especially the second installment, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5212.html">Perils of Potential Pareto</a>.</em></p>
    <p><em>That series is the best economics writing I've ever done! But this is shorter and more ranty.</em></p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>In the beginning, there were they were just Benthamites. The greatest good for the greatest number, all of that. But they were always ambitious fucks. It was never enough for them to have a view, their view had to be writ, had to be <em>science</em>. You can <em>claim</em> that this or that action produces the greatest good for the greatest number, but how do you measure it? How do you prove it? Suppose you with the same resources you can feed ten people or entertain a thousand. Feeding a hungry person is a greater good, perhaps, than entertaining a fat one, but how much greater? Is it only 90 times the greater good, in which case the resources should go straight to Broadway, or 101 times the greater good, in which case the soup kitchen should get it? Benthamites could opine, but they could not <em>measure</em>. They had no means by which to persuasively contradict cretins who would make the opposite call.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>So, they declared economics an <em>empirical</em> science. "Henceforth," they shouted, about a century ago, "we shall base our conclusions only upon what we can (at least in principle) measure!" <em>Utility</em>, the phlogisten of the Benthamite creed, the hypothetical substance of good that was to be maximized across a population, was recast as "ordinal". We cannot know whether one hungry person's meal is worth more or less than 100 feted people's entertainment. But we can know that the hungry person, given a choice, will choose the meal over the musical. We can order and rank the value of goods to an individual, even if we can't measure the distance or difference between them, or make comparisons across different people. And, thanks to our man <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto</a>, we can offer a <em>scientific</em>, <em>empirical</em>, can't-dispute-this-motherfucker account of the good. If some action or policy will make <em>at least one person</em> better off (i.e. they would choose their new circumstance over their old), and make <em>no other people worse off</em> that, that, is indisputable an improvement. Here is a criterion that involves only observable (at least "in principle") rankings, and that requires no comparisons of unmeasurable welfare across different people! Hurrah! Those cretins have to listen to us now.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Only. At the level of public policy, where economists aspire to rule (for the betterment of all, of course), there are almost no actions that meet the Pareto criterion. If you want to build a new public park for free, there is always some motherfucker who <em>loves</em> the wild shrubbery already there and <em>hates</em> the idea that loud, laughing children might interrupt his afternoon idyll. If (as economists always did) you want to open the borders to trade, there is always someone who will be put out of work by cheaper imports. The Pareto criterion was arguably <em>scientific</em>, but, as John Hicks famously <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2225023">put it</a>, this "economic positivism might easily become an excuse for the shirking of live issues, very conducive to the euthanasia of our science." And without our science, all that will be left are the cretins.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>So, Hicks, along with <a href="https://www.hujingbei.net/upload/2007_11/07110714361173.pdf">Nicholas Kaldor</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1907054">Harold Hotelling</a> came up with a workaround. Render unto the cretin the things which are the cretin's, but unto the economist the things which are the economist's. The economist cannot make claims about who should get what, the ten hungry people or the thousand fat circus-goers. That is a judgment of <em>values</em>. It is beyond science, so must be left to the cretins and their <em>politics</em>. However, we can observe whether some action would create a situation where <em>if</em> you taxed some of the people who would very much prefer the new situation <em>and</em> gave the proceeds to the people who would otherwise be grumpy about it, then <em>everyone</em> would prefer (or at worst be indifferent) to the new reality. If economists <em>require</em> the cretins — err, politicians — to actually perform this redistribution in order for it to be scored "efficient", then it is just the Pareto criterion. But, of course, economists knew very well that politicians would not in fact usually redistribute to make real some hypothetical Kumbaya. So they washed their hands of it. If everyone <em>could have been made</em> better, or at least no worse off, by an action <em>if some redistribution had occured</em>, then clearly the action itself "makes the pie bigger". We can score it as <em>scientifically</em> more efficient. That the cretins are unwilling to do the distribution? Hey, that's a values question, not our problem. Economists again could don the authority of science to tell us all what must be done. NAFTA is <em>efficient</em>! You don't understand arithmetic if you disagree.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>But oh no! It turns out (curse the name of <a href="https://www.hujingbei.net/upload/2007_11/07110714376633.pdf">Tibor de Scitovsky</a>!) this criterion of <em>potential</em> Pareto improvement is not an ordering. There are actions where, if we were to perform the action, the "winners" could compensate the "losers", and they would all be better off. But if we do not <em>actually</em> compensate the losers, <em>reversing the same action</em> and letting the initial losers compensate the undoing of the winners might <em>also</em> make everybody better off! (For a detailed treatment of this, follow the pictures <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5212.html">here</a>.) It is <em>incoherent</em> to declare something an efficiency improvement and then declare its reversal an efficiency improvement, but that is the <em>cul de sac</em> our poor scientists had backed themselves into. To this very day, economists do not have a practical criterion by which to declare an action or policy authoritatively "efficient", should cretins have the temerity to disagree. (There is the Pareto criterion, of course, in theory.)</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>To really twist the knife, one economist examined the cycles Scitovsky had discovered and concluded this problem was very general. In a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2023/03/06/P41.pdf">Rand Corporation note</a> that was the foundation of a celebrated, seminal result, this economist acknowledged, "the compensation principal does not provide a true ordering of social decisions. It is the purpose of this note to show that this phenomenon is very general."</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>That economist was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</a>, and if you've taken any economics at all, you've probably learned about the result that emerged from the Rand note. It is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem">Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</a>. But when you learned about that result, I bet you didn't learn that its original object was the <em>impossibility</em> of authoritative technocracy. Social actions cannot in general be ranked under the ordinal utility constraint economists impose upon themselves. Instead, you learned that it was about the impossibility of a good <em>voting system</em>, if we impose the constraints economists invented for themselves upon how we conceive of voting systems!</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other words, after struggling for decades to come up with a basis to make authoritative claims beyond politics, the economics profession realized by about 1950 that, at least on the terms they had prescribed for themselves, it was impossible. They had no criterion, and could have no criterion, by which they could elevate their conclusions as "scientific" and above the fray. What was to be done? Well, we know what they did.</p>
    <p>They took the weapon they invented, this theorem that damned their own authority, and they pointed it at the rest of us. They stopped talking about the impossibility of ranking social actions, but loudly proclaimed their theorem foreclosed the possibility of coherent democratic choice. If someone must be silenced by this discovery, it would not be <em>our profession</em>, it will be the cretins, the quarrelsome public with its crass politics.</p>
    <p>Our voting systems as we actually understand them are not, in fact, touched by the impossibility theorem, because we generally conceive of votes in <em>cardinal</em> rather than <em>ordinal</em> terms. Economists forbid themselves interpersonal comparisons, but in politics we have no trouble asserting that <em>my vote expresses a preference of the same weight as yours</em>. What economists foreswore because they could not measure, in politics we impose as an axiom on normative grounds.</p>
    <p>We are taught that Arrow's theorem condemns democracy when in fact it condemns economic technocracy. That doesn't mean voting systems <em>can</em> be made perfect: It remains true that no voting system meets all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_criteria">many, sometimes conflicting, criteria</a> we might desire of one. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard%27s_theorem">no deterministic voting system is immune</a> from strategic voting when there are more than two candidates. (We should consider <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7043.html">stochastic voting systems!</a>)</p>
    <p>Still, I find it breathtaking. This very result that economists understood perfectly well meant they had no sound basis for judging social action with authority beyond other approaches, they (we?) marketed as damning the other approaches.</p>
    <p>Economists are such scoundrels.</p>

    <p>Living in Florida, I <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/florida-bill-would-require-bloggers-who-write-about-governor-to-register-with-the-state/">am</a> <a href="https://www.nysun.com/article/desantis-ally-in-florida-wants-to-rewrite-landmark-libel-law">giving</a> <a href="https://pen.org/florida-book-bans-empty-shelves/">some</a> <a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/ultimate-cancel-act-florida-democratic-party/43125234">thought</a> to the question of fascism. What is it? Why does it come to be? How do its pathologies emerge? What, if any, are its virtues?</p>
    <p>Obviously there are legions of academics who write and debate and parade on MSNBC about this stuff. I defer to their authority. I'm trying to work stuff out for myself, from my own observations and understanding of the world. I expect the result will be incomplete and inadequate.</p>
    <p>The use of fascism as an epithet, as a kind of rhetorical "cooties" that discredits whomever can be somehow associated with it, prevents us from thinking clearly about a phenomenon whose roots go too deep to simply shun away.</p>
    <p>Fascism, I think, represents an approach to solving the key problem of modern nation-states: How do we build and sustain a capacity for effective social coordination over scales so large that people's interests and identities are likely to be diverse and conflictual?</p>
    <p>Liberal approaches take diversity and disagreement as axiomatic. They strive to build institutions of coordination that accommodate difference and are resilient to it.</p>
    <p>Fascist approaches, on the other hand, see diversity and disagreement as obstacles to fruitful coordination that are malleable. If coordination at scale is hard because people disagree, what if we could make them disagree less?</p>
    <p>Right here a core dispute between liberalism and fascism emerges. The contemporary liberal slogan "diversity is our strength" (which fascists signally mock) is based on the idea that with diversity comes a kind of collective intelligence or capability. But even at an individual level, intelligence has a Hamlet problem. Intelligent people weigh conflicting viewpoints, and may sometimes be slower to act than a person who acts briskly on impulse. Smart people dither.</p>
    <p>Most of us would acknowledge that, on balance, it is better to weigh multiple perspectives and ideas prior to acting, even though doing so consumes time and resources. But we would also concede that there are limits to desirable deliberation. A person may contain multitudes so divergent and clamorous that he becomes paralyzed, indecisive.</p>
    <p>Liberalism emphasizes the risks of acting unintelligently, while fascism emphasizes the risks of failing to act. That may be a high-minded dispute, but things get a bit muckier once we drill into how societies render diversity malleable.</p>
    <p>To a first — <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6632.html">I think inadequate!</a> — approximation, liberal societies can't and don't, they accept diversity and celebrate it. Fascist societies, on the other hand, are fundamentally characterized by the <em>means</em> they use to engender social consensus, to bind together the famous <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/459504/fasces-fascism-and-how-the-alt-right-continues-to-appropriate-ancient-roman-symbols/">fasces</a>.</p>
    <p>In particular they</p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>Conflate the state with a personalist leader, then sacralize the state;</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Define enemies, internal and external, who menace the sacred state and leader;</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Attribute to those enemies any form of dissent that the leader/state deems problematic;</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Punish those they mark as enemies or collaborators harshly; and</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Control or suppress media to prevent subversion by enemies.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>This can be an effective recipe for encouraging consensus and easing coordination at scale!</p>
    <p>The carrot is the cult. Humans have a natural inclination to submit to virtues that transcend ourselves, and the sacred state embodied in the loving leader is an attractive outlet for this inclination. Most fascists don't perceive themselves as villains or sycophants. They perceive themselves as patriots. The sacralized state ceases to be an institution for wielding coercive power, but becomes indistinguishable from the <em>volk</em>, the virtuous people.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/05/what-is-fascism/#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>The stick, of course, is inimicalization: becoming defined as the enemy. You are with us or you are against us. There are no nuances, no third ways. If you are against us, you are the enemy. The least you can expect is exile. As Putin <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/03/16/russia-putin-issues-warning-to-scum-traitors-who-he-will-spit-out-like-a-midge-16290186/">put it</a>, "Any people, and especially the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths."</p>
    <p>If you are an enemy and you do not leave, you will be persecuted. The fascist tendency does not require, or even <em>usually</em> result in, persecution to the point of extermination. But that is the direction of the logic. <em>In extremis</em>, in crisis, fascist orders, like most social orders, will double-down on their logics when they seem to have failed, rather than concede and accept reform that discredits the reigning establishment.</p>
    <p>Fascism requires its enemies. It is no coincidence that the <a href="https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/the-temptations-of-carl-schmitt">man who defined politics around a chasm of friend vs enemy</a> became the political theorist of the Third Reich. If there are not at first obvious enemies threatening the sacred state, then soon there will be, there must be. They will be invented, discovered, provoked, because without the enemy threat, there is insufficient cause and therefore insufficient social capacity to suppress the unruliness that fascism exists to overcome.</p>
    <p>The fascist state and the fascist citizen are capable of anything. They are not bound by bourgeois morality, because they are the ones menaced and victimized by enemies internal and external. The offenses they commit are always, with a deeper analysis, acts of self-defense. It is the enemy who must bear the moral responsibility.</p>
    <p>This attitude creates license, which increases the capacity of a fascist order (relative to systems more prone to moral noise) to execute goal-directed, coordinated social action. It explains why fascist state action often seems immoral to outsiders but virtuous to insiders.</p>
    <p>But while a fascist order may act more freely and more quickly than competitors, it may also act more stupidly. Systems that consider diverse perspectives and weigh options carefully have their virtues too.</p>
    <p>Regarding enemies, it's worth noting that social arrows usually go both ways, and an undeniable threat that cannot plausibly be described as ginned-up will reproduce much of the logic of fascism even in states whose leaderships and publics may not be ideologically inclined to it. Every country at war, when the stakes grow sufficiently high, makes an idol of the state and of victory, identifies forms of dissent threatening to the existing state as collaboration (intentional or in effect) with the enemy, and persecutes those perceived as actual or likely collaborators. There are <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/02/ukraine-censorship-authoritarianism-illiberalism-crackdown-police-zelensky">few surprises here</a>.</p>
    <p>An existential conflict really is (in the phrase made famous by Nazi theorist Schmitt) a state of exception. Fascism can be understood as a means of rendering permanent the clarity, conformity, and collective decisiveness that publics usually tolerate only when they perceive exceptional threat.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the stupidest idea that everyone takes for granted is that higher education in the United States is left-wing.</p>
    <p>If "left" and "right" have any meaning at all, "right" describes a worldview under which civilized society depends upon legitimate hierarchy, and a key object of politics is properly defining and protecting that hierarchy.</p>
    <p>"Left", on the other hand, is animated by antipathy to hierarchy, by an egalitarianism of dignity. While left-wing movements recognize that effective institutions must place people in different roles — sometimes hierarchical, sometimes associated with unequal rewards — these are contingent, often problematic, overlays upon a foundational assertion that every human being has equal dignity and equal claim to the fundamental goods of human life.</p>
    <p>Whatever else colleges and universities do in the United States, they define and police our most consequential social hierarchy, the dividing line between a prosperous <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7263.html">if precarious</a> professional class and a larger, often immiserated, working class. The credentials universities provide are no guarantee of escape from paycheck-to-paycheck living, but statistically they are a near prerequisite.</p>
    <p>The academy itself is incredibly hierarchical. Within a university, distinctions reign between a graduate student or postdoc, an adjunct, an assistant professor on tenure track, an associate versus full professor. These ranks are salient and consequential, treated as legitimate and earnestly policed.</p>
    <p>Nothing is spared hierarchy in academia. Institutions are organized into pecking orders. Harvard University and Towson University are not the same. Everyone understands their relative rank, the <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803104247382;jsessionid=A3607E3AA98E806AB399FC75DC2F9817">social consequences of which</a> are very real.</p>
    <p>If you are an academic at a level beyond community college or adjunct professorship, you have devoted your life to swimming upstream, besting competitors who will relegated to lower ranks or simply expectorated from academic life. It is a key part of your job to rank and sort other people, whether they be the undergrads that you grade or the faculty your department hires. You strive to have your work published in "top-tier" journals.</p>
    <p>To be an academic and be left-wing is like being a fish opposed to water. It is not persuasive. Or it ought not to be.</p>
    <p>Of course it is true that the vast majority of professors "identify" as progressive or liberal or left. That is understandable! At a mass level, the left-wing view that we are fundamentally equal in dignity has won the day. Even political movements that claim to be right-wing, that act overtly to defend and entrench social hierarchies, must pay lip-service to egalitarian norms to have any success in our electral democracy.</p>
    <p>Professors are people too. They don't like to think of themselves as the bone structure of our society's most consequentially oppressive hierarchy. Individually, they are wonderful people. And they are smart. They understand at some level that their role is problematic. But, individually, there is nothing they can do about that. They could opt out, cede their slot to the next striver, but that wouldn't change anything about the structure of our society and the role of academia within it. And it would cost them personally, tremendously.</p>
    <p>So, successful academics hew a path quite analogous to that taken by so many graduates of the prestigious schools they run. "I'll work at McKinsey, or Goldman, or Google, because doing so will provide me with resources to do some good, later, somehow." Academics, like most of us, would prefer a less hierarchical society, but they tell themselves that the best they can do is gain some social power by... contending for an elite position inside the hierarchy and using whatever influence comes from that to further a less hierarchical ideal. This attempt to use the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/291810-for-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house">master's tools to dismantle the master's house</a> is not very convincing on its face, so academics have to work unusually hard to convince themselves that they are not bad people. This encourages an unusually expressive and radical politics.</p>
    <p>Universities become bastions of an ostentatious "leftism" even while these same leftists perform the workaday labor of sorting and excluding upon which our stratified society depends. I'm not a fan of psychological explanations for political difference, but it does seem a touch neurotic.</p>
    <p>It is also counterproductive, in two respects:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>While <em>individually</em> academics may be helpless to affect the unequal distributions of dignity and deserts which their vocations undergird, collectively they have tremendous capacity to reform and reshape academia. Instead of taking pride in how exclusive their institutions are, professors could work as a group to discredit the conflation of exclusivity and merit. If a Harvard degree is so valuable, professors could insist the university franchise as liberally as McDonalds and grow the freshman class to tens of thousands. That should be practical, if the value-add is actual education. If Harvard's value to undergraduates is based on scarcity and social connection, well maybe that's the kind of institution the very best academics, if their political commitments are real, should refuse — <em>as an organized class, rather than as ineffectually expressive individuals</em> — to participate in at all.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>The combination of flamboyant left-wing expression and bitterly exclusive hierarchical norms that nearly everyone has experienced directly (perhaps at a high-school level when they were sorted as unlikely to be college material) discredits left-wing political activism broadly as a sham.</p>
      <p>Right-wing grievance entrepreneurs complain that they have been locked out of the institutions and must make a long march to retake them. They pretend that Gramsci and Marcuse have won the culture for "the left" and their only hope is some desperate hail mary. Don't be a fucking idiot and take them at their word.</p>
      <p>Right-wing grievance entrepreneurs go after higher education because its role in politics is incoherent and hypocritical, in a way that the public viscerally experiences. Universities are attacked not because "the left" is strong within them, but because the academy's paperthin but shouty commitment to equal dignity makes it easy to present the whole left project as fake, a trojan horse by which some sanctimonious elite is going to jam down arrangements under which <em>their</em> dignity and prosperity will somehow always be first among equals.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Academia is right-wing, structurally. Diversifying academia in the conventional sense, bringing more members of underrepresented groups into higher rungs of the hierarchy, would not alter that fact. Left academics who analyze structural injustice so assiduously might take this obvious reality into greater account.</p>
    <p>Because as things stand, while academics sanctimoniously (and correctly!) opine about fascism and structural racism, the institutions they serve have become ever more consequential gatekeepers in an ever more extractive relationship with the students they purport to serve. Perhaps there are causes more proximate than 1619 why the public has become predisposed not to take alarms rung by earnest professors at face value.</p>

    <p>After you’re dead, do you care if it’s the end of the world?</p>
    <p>New College is my goto metaphor when I contemplate death. You wonder what it will be like, all of life is this vivid stream of experience, and then all of a sudden it's just... gone?</p>
    <p>The high-school drama cliché play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Town">"Our Town"</a> always brings me to tears. In the play, a town's graveyard becomes a kind of a greek chorus or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Town">MST3K</a> riff. The dead once set there become spectators, chatting about the antics of the living. Only, over time, they become ever more forgetful and indifferent. The living world begins, when you are among the living, as an object of such intensity and care. You cannot help but feel pain, excitement, love, annoyance, hatred, hope, disappointment, triumph, anxiety, joy. The living world draws from you such attention. But time comes. Eventually it washes away all of your attention, all of your care.</p>
    <p>When I think of death I think of New College because the difference between life there and life after was a difference in kind like that. It was not (like physical death only sometimes is) a sharp transition. You graduate, you move away. You still know some people, keep in touch. But eventually it occurs to you that your ever less frequent chatter is like the gossiping among denizens of Thornton Wilder's cemetary.</p>
    <p>When I wonder how it will be to be dead, this is what I think. Experience is irreducible, axiomatic, beyond explanation or science. Whatever I am that experiences will in some indeterminate sense continue to experience.</p>
    <p>But care, care is contingent and fragile, an equilibrium balanced on the tip of a single strand of hair, at the mercy of an indifferent physics. Care depends upon memory, also fragile. I think I won't remember, just like now I can hardly remember the stream of years of days — rapids rather than a babbling brook — that was my time at New College.</p>
    <p>When I was at New College, I was a New College nationalist. There were politics then and now, and I realized, standing one day in <a href="https://michaeljamesfreedman.com/products/palm-court">Palm Court</a>, that I would die for New College, for that place, that community, if that were somehow called for. I was probably twenty years old, and I understood quite self-consciously how ridiculous this would seem to, well, almost everybody. New College, after all, is just a college. It is a means to an end. It is preparing us, the story goes, for something greater, for our productive adult lives.</p>
    <p>I knew that's how the world would think. But the world is full of idiots. I remembered life before New College and I knew, quite correctly, that life afterwards was more likely to be banal than something greater just because now I would have a degree and <em>skillz</em>.</p>
    <p>New College was a stab at utopia. A stab. Life at New College was sharp and often painful. But we together flew closer to the sun than I would ever fly before or since. The purpose of New College wasn't to prepare us for the next thing, but for us to live together more richly and more fully, intellectually and otherwise, than would ever be possible in the world surrounding us. If the institution had a role to play in the larger world, it was not to produce more Fulbright Scholars and doctoral students, better <em>US News</em> rankings. That might be a kind of cover story, the justification for our funding, whatever. Our role was to experience an intensity of <a href="https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/">conviviality</a> that our society can no longer remember or sustain, and carry some spark of that memory, some fading ember, when the academic cycle cast us out like dandelion seeds, like balooning spiderlings. Perhaps something from the experience would be left in our venom. I hope, dear reader, somewhere in all these words I've written, now and over 16 years, just a little bit of that poison has found you.</p>
    <p>Ron DeSantis is <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2023/02/15/why-does-ron-desantis-want-to-fix-a-high-ranking-college/">trying to transform</a> New College into <a href="https://www.hillsdale.edu/">Hillsdale College</a> or whatever. He's an asteroid hitting a planet, pulled by some political gravity, stupid and indifferent to what he is destroying. New College is not just some "liberal arts college" that is woke or left-wing. It's a liberal arts college like Dr. Who's mode of transport was a telephone booth. Yes, sure, but perhaps also a bit more than that.</p>
    <p>I cannot speak to how "woke" New College has or hasn't become. I've been dead — I'm sorry, graduated — almost thirty years. But I suspect there is some continuity, between whatever thrives now on that sunny little campus and the experiment in living I was once a part of.</p>
    <p>The dead forget so much and care so little. Time scatters and numbs us. Yet, whether the fact is hopeful or it is tragic, it turns out the dead do still care about the end of the world. We can feel just that much pain.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Postscript:</strong></p>
    <p>Here is me circa 1993, from some marketing thing produced then by the college. Thanks Alice Abarca for having unearthed it. The shirt, which Camilla Mortensen and I screened with Gary Jurman's help, fits surprisingly into contemporary court cases and culture wars. But to pay much attention to that misses every meaningful point.</p><img alt="a quote and photo of the author, spewing the same views he spews here, but in 1993" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/27/new-college/from-1993-admissions-catalog-via-alice-abarca.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>I find myself falling into old habits.</p>
    <p>In a shower, on a walk, I am composing a future post. Already there are three or four, already much of what has been composed has been forgotten.</p>
    <p>I like to imagine the things I forget in this way are not lost, but are fertilizer. What is best will rise from the loam when I rouse myself to think of it again, when I actually. Write. The. Post.</p>
    <p>But most of those posts never get written. Sometimes (the result of a previous round of enthusiasm and angst to do something about this) I'll scribble some kind of draft or outline in a notes app I pay for only to make myself feel guilty for not using. The "interfluidity" folder there now has tens of notes of representing intended posts. Often a note is just a title, which I imagine will be sufficient to revive the conversation with myself that inspired it. Some of those titles are completely inscrutable to me now.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/21/hello/index.html">point of this "drafts blog"</a> was to skip the whole thing-I-intend-to-write-about-in-future step, and just write the damned thing instead. Badly, imperfectly, a first draft. But publicly, because what I don't do publicly I feel like I have not done at all. For some posts, there are paragraphs or even pages of text in the notes app. They are nothing until (right around the heat death of the universe) I draft the post.</p>
    <p>I've been hoping, but failing, to write a post a day on this blog. But maybe it'd be better to strive for that style of blogging that all the young, ambitious journalists used to grind, several posts a day, just a few hundred words each.</p>
    <p>I doubt I will pull that off. But maybe if the expectation is I write multiple times a day, when I find myself walking and talking and composing I'll just run to the machine and write something.</p>
    <p>I've blogged for almost two decades, but I don't like how I've been doing it. It hasn't been working. I want to do something else. Just write the damned thing instead.</p>

    <p>In the graphic at the heart of <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/22/four-quadrants-of-section-230ishness/index.html">the previous draft</a>, I used the term "thick antitrust". I want to unpack that a bit.</p>
    <p>Often when we think of antitrust, we think of "a cop on the beat", blocking mergers, policing price collusion, breaking up consolidations of economic power. And we do want such cops on the beat! I am very grateful that we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Khan">Lina Khan</a> as the chair of the FTC.</p>
    <p>However, a very <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1258156478.shtml">old</a> <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/197.html">theme</a> at <em>interfluidity</em> is that we should prefer structural over supervisory solutions. Regulators come and go, enforcement of a given regulatory scheme may be a priority of one administration and then actively undermined by the next. Industry interests are consistent and persistent in a way that political fashions are not. Over time, the probability that supervisory agencies will become largely captured by the industries they regulate approaches one, until, predicatably, a crisis emerges from the misregulation which provokes the politicians pick up their pitchforks for a minute and the cycle begins anew.</p>
    <p>If you've given any thought to the idea of structural racism, you understand that subtle structural facts can lead to outcomes that are quite durable and are perceived by the broad public as ordinary or even "natural". But if we can encode vice into structure, we can also encode virtue.</p>
    <p>The best regulation does not look like regulation at all, but is embedded in the structure of institutions we take for granted, yielding desirable outcomes without very much need for continual enforcement. For example, Jane Jacobs taught us that the broad, tranquil plazas mid-20th-century urban planners imagined and tried to design were structurally incoherent. You don't get tranquility in vast, mostly empty, urban spaces. You get crime. Yes, you can try to address this by hiring lots of cops to supervise the space. But a better approach is to encourage busy, bustling streetscapes. "Eyes on the street", along with the proprietary interest of shopkeepers and neighbors in the safety of their neighborhood, will do a far better job, more reliably, more cheaply, largely invisibly.</p>
    <p>"Thick antitrust" is the idea that we should craft a regulatory environment in which undesirable forms of scale are simply not adaptive. We can rely less on fragile policing of economic power when provision at scale is uneconomic.</p>
    <p>Usually, regulation seeks to <em>enable</em> scale on efficiency grounds, and it is not always wrong to do so. How often do you hear lobbyists and regulators alike aver that firms "should not have to contend with 50 different regulatory schemes in 50 different states"? Whether by harmonizing state laws or imposing a Federal framework that preempts them, we usually work to make the marketplace friendly to large-scale business.</p>
    <p>And often that's the right thing to do! When we want a national marketplace in a good or service, when we think there are <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8882.html">socially valuable economies of scale</a> such that competition should be structured between firms that serve or aspire to serve the national market, then we should harmonize or preempt. We can gain scale efficiencies and prevent predation by local monopolies if we sustain a competitive national market.</p>
    <p>But that "if" is critical. A single national marketplace is very legible to businesspeople interested in consolidating to gain market power, and to financiers who understand that scarcity and control is the only path of sustainable "alpha". When we encourage scale, we may gain efficiencies, but we accept tacit liabilities, including the cost of vigilant supervision and the much greater cost of forseeable failures of that supervision. It's a balance.</p>
    <p>For many activities, it's better simply to render firm-level scale uneconomical. Of course we want "network effects" on the internet. Network effects are why we built the internet in the first place, duh. But we want the value that comes from interconnection to accrue to participants of the network broadly, rather than being captured within a few very fortunate firms. Precisely because network effects are so strong on the internet, we should seek regulation that favors enterprise at smaller scales. The value of the network can then be captured only by interoperability, by adherence to open standards under which many participants compete on fairly equal terms to provide and profit from connectivity.</p>
    <p>Because intrafirm coordination costs are far lower than the burdens associated with developing open standards, it will always be possible for an "innovator" to provide more value faster by growing network applications under its sole control. But this is the first step towards Cory Doctorow's <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/">"enshittification" dynamic</a>. Yes, "blitzscaling" creates an initial spurt of value for customers that is real, and could not have been created so quickly without the proprietary startup. But the cost of that front-loaded fast growth is a tail of predation and extraction and stagnation extending far into the future. The "innovator" will have enclosed for itself all the value that we, the network, create, and will make it difficult for new innovators to emerge.</p>
    <p>It isn't worth it. On the internet, and in finance (another domain where network effects entrench pernicious concentrations of power in early winners), we want to craft regulatory regimes under which scale becomes burdensome. But effective regulation demands elegance. If you just prohibit scale, a million clever lawyers will synthesize a megafirm out of a thousand LLCs, and a perpetual cat-and-mouse game will begin.</p>
    <p>That's much, much better than doing nothing, just bend over and get Googled! But it's still not great.</p>
    <p>One elegant way to discourage market power in an industry is to privilege, for regulatory purposes, aspects of the business that (in the ultimate tech-firm insult) "do not scale". Perhaps, as Section 230 proponents argue, you don't want to just default to the tort system as a regulator of internet firms, safe harbors are necessary to ensure an ecosystem of open and vibrant internet forums. Okay.</p>
    <p>But then rather than offering a blanket shield to any entity that can quilt their speech out of third-party content, why not craft a safe harbor for firms that demonstrate that they moderate and curate with careful attention to context by people informationally local to the speakers and familiar with subcultural norms? <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/24/thick-antitrust/#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>Alternatively, some industries can be constructed from whole cloth out of regulation. Notaries, for example, exist to fill a slot created by regulatory norms. So does the legal industry more broadly. And modern banking. Most banks hold not a nugget of gold in any vault, all of the goods and services they provide are made of regulatory fabrications, yet we perceive banks as perfectly natural and quite essential.</p>
    <p>There's been wide-ranging debate on the concept of "information fiduciaries", introduced most prominently by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/">Jack Balkin and Jonathan Zittrain</a>. Balkin and Zittrain argue that we can make our peace with the megaplatforms that have become both indispensible and intolerable by imposing upon them a framework of legal obligations under which they'd be required they put users' interests before their own in handling the data we entrust to them.</p>
    <p>Critics, <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/2019/12/a-skeptical-view-of-information-fiduciaries/">including</a> the redoubtable Lina Khan, are correctly skeptical. Firms like Facebook, Google, Twitter exist at the scale they do only because of business models based on surveillance of users and an undesirable influence over our collective cognition. Imposing a "fiduciary" obligation upon them would either wrap these harms beneath a sanctimonious legal fig leaf, or else necessitate a transformation tantamount to complete destruction of these firms in their present form.</p>
    <p>But what if we defined an entirely new category of actor, an intermediary who would have legal roles like a notary (current pratices surrounding electronic signatures are absurd), who would function as caretakers of personal data, intermediating between ordinary humans and monsters like Google, with whom nonprofessional individuals cannot meaningfully contend? And what if we enshrined, as a foundational requirement of this new industry, a limit on the ratio between legally responsible humans and the clients to whom they owe their duty?</p>
    <p>It wouldn't scale. Thank goodness.</p>

       <p>Of course, forums should still address any external harms their services cause.

    <p>I think it unlikely that the Supreme Court will find liability in these cases. They might well nibble at the edge of Section 230, distinguishing the present facts from facts under which they might find platform liability despite the Section 230 shield, and that might prove consequential going forward. In the Twitter case, they seem eager to consider some questions about the Anti-Terrorism Act (the act that creates the liability that Section 230 might shield). But the Court understands that serious modification of the judiciary's broad interpretation of Section 230 would dramatically upend a large swathe of the economy, with questionable democratic legitimacy.</p>
    <p>Of course, this Court has been willing to countenace disruption and accept a loss of legitimacy where they are sufficiently ideologically motivated, as they were with abortion. But with the possible exception of Justice Thomas, I don't think there is that kind of motivation here.</p>
    <p>It's not a balls and strikes thing. I think it's entirely reasonable, as a substantive and legal matter, to argue that contemporary algorithmic recommendation and suppression is so different in scale and kind and consequence from the kind of moderation lawmakers considered in 1996 that Section 230 protections might not apply.</p>
    <p>But whatever the merits or demerits of that argument in theory, in practice a whole economy has been built around an aggressive interpretation of Section 230. I think it's a rotten economy, but the Court won't want to unilaterally tear it down, they'll want (probably appropriately) to punt these questions to Congress.</p>
    <p>As readers may or may not know, I've become a <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8093.html">Section 230</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/trump-fighting-section-230-wrong-reason/617497/">skeptic</a>. At a theoretical level, I think Section 230 enshrines a balance of liabilities that is quite perverse. If I, in private anger, text something defamatory about a third party to a friend who then publicly tweets my text, neither of the parties meaningfully responsible for whatever injury the defamed party suffers (the forwarder or the broadcaster) can be held liable, because Section 230 shields them. Only I, who communicated under an expectation of privacy, can be. I think that's dumb.</p>
    <p>But okay, it's an edge case. My animus towards Section 230 is about its central tendency, which has been to eliminate from the profit-and-loss statement very real diseconomies of scale associated with interpreting and curating speech well. Given the reality of network effects, eliminating these countervailing diseconomies has bequeathed to us a consolidated information sphere, dominated by massive platforms whose incentives are to promote engagement rather than high quality deliberation.</p>
    <p>Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. are implicated in profound, undeniable harms precisely because they cannot, for example, understand whether or not a post in Myanmar is promoting extermination and genocide. But they can broadcast that post regardless, and profit from the attention it provokes.</p>
    <p>Curating public speech well is an activity that is inherently artisanal, community and context bound. This centrifugal fact should counterbalance the yawning pull of network effects, except we've eliminated as a matter of law any reason for firms to pay attention to it. As a consequence, our public square has become Wonder Bread but worse: mass-produced and low quality, but enriched with no vitamins and minerals other than arsenic. For their trouble, the providers of this disservice have grown into prosperous and predatory monopolies, with profoundly antidemocratic power over public speech.</p>
    <p>Section 230 seemed like a good idea at the time, but we've run the experiment. The results aren't good.</p>
    <p>That's my view. A lot of people I usually agree with (including my past self!) vehemently support Section 230. I think I was mistaken, and they are mistaken. Yes, we want public forums on the internet, and we should craft a liability regime that renders it practical to operate one. But we want deliberation and controversial speech to inhabit a diverse array of smaller, higher quality public forums, with radically divergent "community standards". Megaplatforms may be okay for baby pictures and how-to videos. They make a terrible public square. There's no meaningful democracy with a terrible public square.</p>
    <p>A great thing about lawsuits is they tend to go where the money is. Section 230 proponents often argue fatalistically that it's no good trying to undo the platform economy by eliminating the law they <a href="https://www.jeffkosseff.com/home">enthuse literally created it</a>, because big platforms can afford lawyers to parry lawsuits, but small forums can't. Sure, but lots of us have blogged for decades with no liability shield, and it's fine, because defamation and other speech torts are hard to prove, and we're not so rich as to make long-shot lawsuits worthwhile.</p>
    <p>Win a case against Facebook, thogh, and you can make millions. Yeah, they can afford lawyers. But unless they err on the side of tremendous caution, they'll need a whole lot of them.</p>
    <p>We should strengthen <a href="https://anti-slapp.org/">anti-SLAPP protections</a>, and define safe-harbors (perhaps a notice period before forum operators become potentially liable for third-party speech). But the blanket immunity provided by Section 230 is just, in my view, a failed experiment.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I didn't plan to write all this. I mostly meant to post this graphic:</p><img alt="Positions on Section 230 mapped into four quadrants" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/22/four-quadrants-of-section-230ishness/section-230-quadrants-white.png" width="100%">
    <p>I think it interesting that on both sides of the Section 230 discourse, there are both free-expression-focused and more censorious tendencies.</p>
    <p>In the upper-left quadrant, we have the old-school internet utopians. They supported, and however disappointed and disillusioned now still mostly support, Section 230 as a straightforward boon to free speech. We want people to be able to express themselves easily and freely on the internet, internet forums are an important venue for that speech, but no one will operate a forum if they'll be liable for whatever crap their users say. So, it felt (and still feels to many) free-speech supportive just to eliminate liability for forum operators, regardless of how much or little those forums moderate or curate or shape content. Forums are good for speech, a liability shield enables and encourages forums, QED, it seemed at the time.</p>
    <p>But it's worth recalling, the core of the <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1070/communications-decency-act-of-1996">Communications Decency Act</a> in which Section 230 is embedded was straightfowardly to censor putatively harmful material from the internet. Section 230 was supported also by people (the upper-right quadrant) who were less concerned with promoting freewheeling expression on-line, and more interested in making it possible for forums to censor. Prior to Section 230, by moderating, a forum operator might be deemed a publisher rather than mere distributor of material, so there was a perverse (pun intended) disincentive to ban or suppress speech operators did not want on their forums.</p>
    <p>Section 230 <em>allowed</em> anything without liability (pleasing the upper-left quadrant), while <em>enabling</em> suppression and censorship (pleasing the upper-right). Whether you were the kind of person who loved passing along <a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Goatse.cx">transgressional memes</a> or wanted censoriously wholesome spaces for families, as long as you were optimistic about a "marketplace of ideas" that would reward what was best, you could believe that Section 230 would serve your cause.</p>
    <p>The bottom-right quadrant is easy to understand. A lot of people are not in favor of an anything-goes public sphere, and are happy for the law to discourage speech they think ought not go. Traditional religious conservatives have no illusions that some marketplace will elevate virtuous speech over porn. They suggest we ban the porn.</p>
    <p>Across the political spectrum, people concerned that less regulated spaces should be safe and welcoming for people, and especially groups often subject to harassment, are under no illusion that a market will solve their problems. They argue that forums should be assiduously policed against what they deem to be harassment or hate speech, and would use the law to insist on this.</p>
    <p>Many of those I've deemed "anti-harrassment activists" would object, I think, to the axiom that underlies my diagram, that there is a trade-off between concern about expression or safety. They would <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2020/07/30/whats-wrong-with-cancel-culture/">argue</a> that in fact the two are complements, that suppressing harassment and hate-speech is in fact encouraging expression by all but the harassers and hate-speakers. Pretty much no one is opposed to "free expression", when you put it that way, but we have radically divergent views about what should count as free expression.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the virtue of their ultimate ends, groups in the bottom right quadrant are willing to use the law to suppress outright certain categories of speech they deem objectionable. (A bit cheekily, I've placed both "woke" and "anti-woke" in the bottom-right quadrant. The anti-woke might object, they are true <em>Free Speech Warriors!</em> but I think it's clear that people polarized on either side of this axis are glad to use the law to block "harmful" speech from the other side. <a href="https://weartv.com/news/local/florida-school-district-removes-library-book-called-pornography-by-desantis-administration-ron-broward-county-lets-talk-about-teen-guide-sex">School libraries in my state</a> are being emptied of "woke" literature, because it's "grooming" or "indoctrination".)</p>
    <p>The quadrant I think most interesting is (perhaps unsurprisingly) the one in which I place myself. I now oppose Section 230, but perceive myself as doing so in support of the same values of free expression that once led me to celebrate that law.</p>
    <p>There are two distinct cases for paring back Section 230 in the name of free expression. First is the case that those I've labeled "populists, conservatives, and fringes" most commonly make: Section 230 affirmatively protects platforms when they censor their views, and it should not.</p>
    <p>If you understand the top-right quadrant, why some 90s-era social conservatives favored Section 230, then you should understand that <em>removing</em> the ability of forum owners to moderate without liability means classes of expression that are in practice frequently moderated away under Secion 230 would become more expressable without it.</p>
    <p>Under the optimistic 1990s view of the internet, it was supposed to be incoherent to talk about even arguably valuable classes of expression "frequently moderated away", because the internet was going to be so open and diverse that any sort of expression anybody valued would have its home somewhere. And that is still true! You can find lots of "cancelled" perspectives at <a href="https://gab.com/">gab.com</a> if you want to.</p>
    <p>But that brings us to the second critique, which is mine.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, we didn't foresee the polarization of "freedom of reach" on the internet. On the contrary, the internet was the vehicle that would give reach to voices locked out of broadcast television and respectable newspapers. Freedom of the press, they say, is worth very little unless you can afford to operate one. The internet would give each of our "home pages" the same reach as <em>The New York Times</em>, if we had something of value to say. The combination of technical availability and meritocracy was going to end concerns about media oligopoly.</p>
    <p>The consolidation of attention beneath a few large platforms has fully revived those concerns. Nazi speech would do poorly under anything I'd recognize as meritocracy, but segregating it from Twitter and onto Gab short-circuits the weighing process, and allows Nazi speakers to argue their ideas are suppressed rather than what they are, which is just dumb.</p>
    <p>It's no good to pull an Elon Musk and just let the Nazis back, because once attention is consolidated onto megaplatforms, there is no "neutral" way for speech to be present. Megaplatform algorithms amplify and suppress, and must amplify and suppress to keep feeds appealing to the eyeballs they sell. Twitter can pretend as much as it wants that its algorithm is objective and orthogonal to the perspectives offered, but in social affairs nothing is orthogonal, choices will entrain correlations, and Nazi shit can be pretty engaging in a tabloidy way. You are either with the Nazis or against them, Elon, which will it be?</p>
    <p>The better solution, I would argue, is for a much less polarized and hierarchical public square. We can't have a world with more than a handful of Twitters, Facebook, YouTube, TikToks. We should prefer a world with a whole lot of Gabs, except most of them would be full of decent and interesting people rather than aggrieved conspiracists. "Virality", the transformation of an individual's local expression to a signal with systematic effects should be hard, a result of consensus rather than mere "engagement". Amplification should be the result of decentralized human choices, not centralized attention-seeking algorithms.</p>
    <p><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> is imperfect in a lot of ways, but it's one "social network" that begins to approach this vision. The "local-first" ethos of the <a href="https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown">hometown</a> Mastodon fork is an even closer fit. It augurs a civil society made up of communities that are by default local and private, from which social consensus might emerge only from meaningfully independent evaluation by diverse communities small enough to be deliberative, rather than via some signal that becomes salient and systematic among individuals by virtue of salaciousness. (Read <a href="https://runyourown.social/">Darius Kazemi</a>.) We are so trained now to seek influence, each of us tiny minnows in a giant ocean hoping our next post or tweet will make us a big fish. We are rendered both pathetic and venal by this dynamic. A sane public square is a composition of diverse and sane communities, not attention-seeking atoms.</p>
    <p>So long as the internet remains hospitable to scale and driven by monetary incentives towards engagement, we won't have diverse, sane communities. We will have giant, manipulative tabloids in the sky.</p>
    <p>But, you might claim, these platforms "won the market test". Why should we pick winners and losers?</p>
    <p>We did pick winners and losers, when in the 1990s we demonetized quality of curation, leaving only attention and engagement to sell. That's what Section 230 does. Absent Section 230, good moderators are financial winners, bad moderators are financial black holes.</p>
    <p>We picked winners and losers in the 1990s when we strengthened "intellectual property law" and passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> both of which render a mix of scale and predatory legal creativity key to market success.</p>
    <p>There is no neutral, in law and technology. We make this stuff up. We picked winners and losers in the 1990s. We made dystopian choices. It is time to revisit them.</p>

    <p>Blogging has gotten pretty stale for me, because it stopped being blogging long ago.</p>
    <p>Blog posts used to be sites for conversation. A one-two punch of professionalization and twitterization killed the traditional blogosphere. (Google's murder of <em>Reader</em> didn't help.)</p>
    <p>As blogging started to become a springboard into journalistic careers or academic notoriety, authors (myself included) felt more and more compelled to police the quality of our posts. Instead of, "Here's what I'm thinking about today, wanna talk about it?" or "Wow, she said something (interesting|wonderful|terrible) let's blockquote the highlights and go through it!", every blog post became a kind of resumé item.</p>
    <p>The quality of blog posts individually much improved, for sure. Many bloggers became edited journalists, for <em>Vox</em> or <em>The New York Times</em> or <em>The Atlantic</em>, and of course articles there are usually much higher quality than a typical old-school blog post.</p>
    <p>The quality of the conversation, however, collapsed. We have now constructed an intellectual world filled with brilliant baubles you can admire but not touch. All this ostentatious quality has made us collectively stupider. On Twitter you can writhe about it all, of course, but it is not the sort of place where ideas cumulate and converge. The best Twitter threads are lost to time in a way that even the most trivial blogposts are not. There are Substacks now, but they are their own pathology, each one a chatty little <i>Netflix</i>.</p>
    <p>I am off Twitter almost entirely now, and thank god. You can <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@interfluidity">find me on Mastodon</a>, and I mean to experiment with using that forum as a comment section, following <a href="https://carlschwan.eu/2020/12/29/adding-comments-to-your-static-blog-with-mastodon/">Carl Schwan</a>, though maybe in a less JavaScriptey way. The death (at least to me) of Twitter has inspired for me a renaissance, technically. All of a sudden, the internet seems open again. I'm building my own static-site generator for this and other sites, thinking about ways to build and play that seemed useless when everyone was going to be on someone else's platform anyway.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I mean to write here, a lot. And very differently. You should assume that everything you see here was written and published in a single sitting. This is a space for first drafts. I hope, in the spirit of Tanner Greer's classic post, it becomes home to many, many <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/in-favor-of-bad-takes/">bad takes</a>.</p>
