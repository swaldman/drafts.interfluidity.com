   <p>Towards the end of a generally excellent piece on housing, Hamilton Nolan <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/housing-is-the-economy">writes</a></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>[I]f your response to that is “hey let’s just build public housing units for all 400,000 people,” that sure sounds nice, but brother I am here to tell you that there are only 177,000 total NYC public housing units right now, and that represents the sum total of all that have been produced in the city’s history, and they don’t even fund the ones that exist adequately right now. So practically speaking, saying “just build public housing” is the equivalent of saying “just give everyone magical castles.” It is a nice goal but it ain’t happening any time soon and in the meantime, everyone needs affordable housing. To reiterate: the only long term path to bringing housing prices down to an affordable level is by building enough housing supply to meet total demand. Build more. Much more.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I fully endorse that last bit. <em>The only long term path to bringing housing prices down to an affordable level is by building enough housing supply to meet total demand. Build more. Much more.</em></p>
   <p>Indeed.</p>
   <p>But I disendorse Nolan's attitude regarding public housing. State-led development is the only solution to our housing catastrophe. We will figure that out, sooner or later. We will be much better off if we can figure it out sooner.</p>
   <p>The problem with YIMBY-ness has never been that YIMBYs are wrong to focus on housing scarcity in places people want to live as perhaps the most destructive economic ill we face. They are right about that!</p>
   <p>Their error has always been a pollyanna-ish idea that <em>if only</em> we would lift legal constraints we can easily understand to be unjust — exclusionary zoning whose roots are in racial segregation! — private markets would just resolve this problem and we would all be okay.</p>
   <p>But NIMBY-ness, as Nolan perceptively describes earlier in the piece, is endogenous to prosperous density:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>In cities where many people want to live, but which fail to build enough new housing every year to keep up with demand, housing prices rapidly reach levels only affordable to the rich. The middle class leaves the expensive cities. They move to less expensive cities, where they constitute an influx of new residents, and they are resented by the existing residents of those cities, who see their own housing prices rise as a result of the influx. Instead of rapidly building a lot of new housing to account for the influx, residents typically channel their resentment into a determination to keep everything as it is, which means a continuing lack of adequate new housing construction, which only serves to drive up rents and home prices further. And the cycle continues, from one city to the next to the next. People leave San Francisco because it’s too expensive and they move to Denver and then they make Denver too expensive and then those people move to Boise and make Boise too expensive and then those people move to your small town. Uh oh! You will teach them a lesson, by organizing your neighbors to fight against the damn new luxury condo building they want to build downtown. Eventually your town will become too expensive as well.</p>
    <p>We need to build more housing. If your city is too expensive it is because there is not enough housing to meet the demand. Build more housing. Stop being selfish.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Note that your town doesn't need to already have zoning laws historically rooted in racial segregation. It will invent them, or it will invent something else, because the people who bought homes they love in neighborhoods they love, upon whose character they have based their security and lifestyle, into whose financial value they have leveraged their net worth several times over, will not stand for leaving those assets to the vicissitudes of private home developers.</p>
   <p>And then there are basic facts of physics and geography. Infill of existing density is challenging and costly. Infrastructure must be retrofit. Even if eventually there will be room for so many more, current residents may need to be displaced (and in practice often never become part of that many more). Greenfields grow ever more distant from the drivers of demand. Together, these factors <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1540-6229.12490">render housing supply curves "convex"</a>. (ht <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/05/what-does-it-look-like-to-build-more-housing.html">Tyler Cowen</a>) In English, what that means is that price increases translate less and less to housing quantity increases as metropolitan areas grow, regardless of the regulatory regime.</p>
   <p>When you are trying to rely upon the market to solve your problem, and then your advice is "stop being selfish", perhaps you should <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/george-packer/end-of-an-era-2-greenspans-world-view-fails-him">encounter the wisdom of Alan Greenspan</a></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>I made a mistake in presuming that...self-interests...were best capable... I have found a flaw. I don’t know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Private markets are based on selfishness. This idea that developers will be motivated by avarice to do just what you want, but homeowners must suspend avariciousness with respect to the asset at the very core of their lives? Good luck with that.</p>
   <p>The YIMBY movement has succeeded, like Max Weber's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/70587-politics-is-a-strong-and-slow-boring-of-hard-boards">proverbial</a> strong and <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/yimbys-keep-winning">slow boring</a> of hard boards, in making some real progress in some particular places. I will concede that, between <a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-and-research/accessory-dwelling-units">liberalization of ADU construction</a> and the astonishing "<a href="https://smdp.com/2024/04/03/californias-most-controversial-housing-law-could-get-a-makeover/">builder's remedy</a>", California has gone farther than I ever imagined it would towards coercing localities to build even against strong opposition of local government's best enfranchised constituents. It isn't nothing. It's a quite extraordinary political achievement. And I don't doubt that it helps, at the margin, for a while.</p>
   <p>But the core problem we face is much bigger than land-use. It is geographic inequality. We have created a country in which too few patches of geography are associated with vastly better opportunities and amenities than all the other places. As with individual inequality, some of this is "natural". Some people are taller than other people, and will have better chances in the NBA. Some places are lovelier and more temperate than other places. However, the actual inequality we are struggling with is not due primarily to these differences, but to our social arrangements. There are plenty of lovely places in the United States that could host remarkable and desirable cities. That they don't is a social outcome, not the result of any natural law.</p>
   <p>So long as just a few places offer so much more amenity, liveliness, and economic opportunity than everywhere else, supply growth in those already built-out places will nowhere near match the tsunami of demand they face from people who would migrate there if they could. The deep flaw in YIMBY-ism is that problem they accurately highlight is orders of magnitude larger than what the solutions they identify, promote, and support can plausibly address. Yet the medicine they propose is divisive and painful to people in established, lived communities, and tend to serve the better-off in favor of the worse-off, as market-based solutions usually do. Regulatory caveats intended to counter gentrification, exhortations to upzone places that are affluent and coveted rather than communities poorer and already precarious are well and good. But they cannot overcome the basic physics of market action, <em>to each according to his purchasing power, from each according to his desperation</em>.</p>
   <p>Even if YIMBYs got all the legal reform they wanted, if all residential construction was by-right and developers had free reign, it's not at all clear housing abundance would result. We've already discussed the factors that overdetermine "convex supply curves", under any regulatory regime. Then there are economic factors beyond regulation. The YIMBY dream is that, if regulatory constraints were lifted, swarms of home developers would engage in ruinous competition to build, driving down the price of the goods they produce and sell. In our contemporary, highly consolidated, economy, how many industries work like this?</p>
   <p>Let's hear from <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/why-we-cant-build-our-way-out-of-this-hot-housing-market/">Logan Mohtashami of HousingWire</a>, whom I think it is fair to characterize as a perpetual bull on the US private sector:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Unless the government steps in to build when new home sales demand gets soft, we will not add homes to the builders’ demand algorithm. Builders have learned to tightly control inventory by retreating from construction when demand becomes slack. Building more homes is bad business during weaker times... We won’t see the construction boom that people want because the builders are here to make money; they’re not here to fix the low inventory issues of the existing home sales market, which is their main rival for demand.</p>
    <p>This is why I have stressed before if you want a construction boom, the federal government will need to step in with deficit financing.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>In general, firms prefer to produce small quantities at high prices, rather than large quantities at low prices, if they can get away with it. For now, for the most part, they get away with it. If you want to be a YIMBY optimist, you have to hope not only for <em>ixnaying</em> exclusionary zoning and environmental reviews and all of that malarky. You will need Lina Khan's very devoted attention to your municipality, in a domain which by its nature is unusually prone to consolidation. Urban construction always requires locality-specific capabilities and connections, and the people who have those are susceptible to being bought out. (I know. Don't be selfish.)</p>
   <p>What YIMBYs get wrong is the actual nature of the scarcity they need to overcome. You cannot, will not, overcome the scarcity of San Francisco. What you can overcome is the scarcity of <em>San Franciscoes</em>. If you create more demand drivers, more places where it becomes desirable to live, where important <a href="https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1256&amp;context=reports">agglomeration effects</a> take hold, you reset the picture. All of a sudden, there are greenfields very near your demand driver, which you can develop at efficient density without colonizing established neighborhoods. Eventually, established neighborhoods in older desirable places will redevelop themselves, in ways their own selfish residents determine, as desirable alternatives elsewhere become competitive threats.</p>
   <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-forever-promises-new-solano-county-investments/"><em>California Forever</em></a> notwithstanding, the private sector is not going to throw around capital in sufficient quantity to invest in places where there's not already a good business case to build — that is, where there's not already an obvious, preexisting demand driver.</p>
   <p>One of my favorite paragraphs I ever wrote is <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6846.html">this one</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>It’s a cliché that the government builds “bridges to nowhere” that the private sector never would build. That’s true. And it’s a credit to the public sector. Bridges to nowhere are what turn nowheres into somewheres. We need many, many more bridges to nowhere.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Turning nowheres into somewheres is a role of the state. It is not an easy role, by any measure. Of course there have been, and will be, failures, boondoggles. You could have tens of billions of dollars worth of boondoggle annually and it wouldn't measure anywhere near the social cost of housing dysfunction in the contemporary United States. All successful enterprises involve failures along the way, and until we <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/11/industrial-policy-and-ecosystems/index.html">develop public sector institutions more tolerant of that</a>, we'll continue to impoverish ourselves and fall behind in geopolitical competition.</p>
   <p>If you want to know how I propose we build, read <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/8772.html"><em>Microcities</em></a>.</p>
   <p>But of course there are a wide variety of possible approaches, and people much, much smarter than I am thinking about this. Before you come at me with your pessimism, yes, Milton Keynes was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/03/struggle-for-the-soul-of-milton-keynes">tragically conceived</a> at the height of automotive exuberance and there are things we should regret about it. But it is a <a href="https://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/news/people/milton-keynes-chosen-for-sunday-times-best-place-to-live-guide-for-first-time-ever-4554727">broadly successful metropolis now</a>. Ordos, China's most famous "ghost city", is booming after the Chinese state <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Society/China-s-largest-ghost-city-booms-again-thanks-to-education-fever">intervened</a> with the "artificial" demand driver of placing competitive schools there.</p>
   <p>States can do these things.</p>
   <p>Neither Milton Keynes nor Ordos strike me as good models to emulate. But in their imperfection they remind us, cities can be made. Even when made not so well, they can thrive, become fine places to live and work. Next time, we'll make them better.</p>
   <p>New cities can house people. And they will, sooner or later.</p>
   <p>In 2018, Saoirse Gowan and Ryan Cooper wrote <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/project/a-plan-to-solve-the-housing-crisis-through-social-housing/"><em>A Plan to Solve the Housing Crisis Through Social Housing</em></a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Sweden, which undertook perhaps the most aggressive public housing plan of any country relative to its size, provides one high-water mark. The Swedish government set a goal of building 1 million new units in the mid-1960s when the population was only 8 million (or about the same size as New York City). Despite a few setbacks and problems, this goal was achieved in less than a decade – indeed it was so successful that Sweden had an oversupply of affordable housing for decades afterward.</p>
    <p>We suggest that 10 million new municipal housing units would be a viable 10-year goal. That is well short of a scaled-up version of the Swedish program, but still quite aggressive. We do not anticipate a U.S. affordable housing oversupply being a significant risk in the medium term.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I know, right? Laugh. In America, we know social housing as public housing, as <em>the projects</em> and we know how that goes. We have not built 10M new units.</p>
   <p>The problem of housing scarcity has only grown worse. As Nolan reminds us, what was once a pathology of San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, has metastasized. Boise has become aspirational too. I'd argue that this is the main reason why younger people (some older ones too!) are pessimistic about the US economy. Housing in the places people want to live is impossibly expensive. The dream of a chill, secure middle-class life in a safe and lively place with good schools is out of reach.</p>
   <p>So far, the housing apocalypse has been a boiling-frog game of musical chairs. The housing situation has worsened in increments, and the losers each round have been the least well-off. That is precisely the sort of problem the American political system is built to ignore. We blame the losers, and segregate ourselves from them. (Until, of course, we find it is our turn to lose.)</p>
   <p>But climate shocks are already beginning to change this. Well enfranchised, safely middle-class Americans are going to find themselves uprooted from homes they purchased as the foundation of their security, some directly by catastrophe, most by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/climate/insurance-homes-climate-change-weather.html">burgeoning insurance costs</a>. We are already in a phase of socialized denial, which we have institutionalized as state-backed insurers of last resort. Very soon, we will see one of those insurers outmatched by nature. Bailouts will be arranged.</p>
   <p>From that moment on, the fiscal calculus will have turned. State-led housing development will no longer be a matter of handouts to losers, supported out of self-regarding pity by liberals, subject to criticism and derision by conservatives. State-led development will be the only means we have of rehousing millions of hard-working families over a limited period of time. Our ability to do it well — to construct new, safer, places where people will genuinely want to live — will go a long way to deciding whether our collective future is dark or bright.</p>
   <p>"Social housing" is not a pie-in-the-sky project. It's an inevitability. We already face a deep and terrible housing crisis. The time to get good at building new communities, to exercise state capacity we will desperately need, to experiment and endure failures we must learn from, is right now.</p>

   <p>The fascist aesthetic worships indomitable strength and the power to smite, sure. But people do not worship what is already theirs. They worship what they yearn to have. Fascists emphasize masculinity and <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/05/28/masculine-virtues/index.html">masculine virtues</a>, but haven't you met these people? Do you listen to their podcasts? Are they self-assured and self-reliant? Disciplined? To borrow their own typology, would you characterize MAGA leaders — quietly in your own minds, not as a matter of public point scoring — as "alphas" or "cucks"? They are anti-gay, but when in power they project strength in the form of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=b061e2632347ae6b&amp;q=putin+topless&amp;uds=ADvngMh7w-lsc2TkqfGrpcdaN0tYhAhYeNGij-sC-yrarFF-M8eXA0VFrOFba5pHfkgoZaIz9SpKk6INNh3RcZGYRBZz1i02EUPNh4RiENv595Jx6z9PYXzxtn6yRbH0pfK3Kx7YptzJevLhFsHJ0aX_EgjeL6JP_X21wKMHXw0djp0LtjQNoQdQr9gpRj915pN1k7TYO2HJGFe-ViNSfNC4F0W69D8zoPTjtHMo6baa3pKjqV3dLqeT_V9TyDMjNL-g-ciNLjrrx8mXtqxQhGjEzd-Ee86YbBVk33ayUwLIXRzNkw7qi0TEiq77MYvz6IVYgNQrlqkN&amp;udm=2&amp;prmd=invsmbt&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiivNXBwcKGAxUsRjABHcRQCgkQtKgLegQIDRAB&amp;biw=1375&amp;bih=938&amp;dpr=2">cartoonish</a> <a href="https://x.com/oliver_drk/status/1677469465968103424">homoeroticism</a>.

   <p>Trump's teflon armor comes not from the inviolability of his carefully crafted image of strength, but from the fact that when you expose him, when you reveal he is in fact just as weak and helpless and persecuted as his supporters (and many of us who are not his supporters) often feel, he never concedes, never apologizes, never backs down, always lashes out. He does not submit to the humilations we submit to, when we endure a really empathetic conversation with HR about how our remark was not up to the standards we are trying to uphold at this company. He is as pathetic as we are. He is us. But he is not so constrained.</p>
   <p>We had the revenge of the nerds and they turned the world into a plutocratic surveillance nightmare. We are ruled by people who still think of themselves as the bullied smart kids and resent critics, despite the tsunamis of predatory cash they ride.</p>
   <p>Now we may have revenge of the losers. I’m sure that will work out well.</p>

   <hr>
   <p>What stood out immediately to me in this graph is the constancy at the middle. Since the World War II peak, rates have collapsed at the high end and at the low end. At middle incomes? Not so much.</p>
   <p>Let's take a look at the same information as cross-sections by income.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1862-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1862-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1862-2024"></a></p>
   <p>Now let's zoom into the post-war period. We'll begin in 1945, when the US had its highest income tax rates, from which they have subsequently collapsed.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1945-2024"></a></p>
   <p>I think it's helpful to divide this picture into four categories:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Ultra high income: income ($10M, $100M)</li>
    <li>High income: ($500K, $1M)</li>
    <li>Middle income: ($63K, $100K, $200K)</li>
    <li>Low income: $10K</li>
   </ul>
   <p>(As of 2022, the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S1903">median income for married couples</a> was about $109,000. Assuming, conservatively, it has remained constant in inflation-adjusted terms, that would be $115,000 dollars today. Real median income has grown over time, and we'll want to encompass a bit above the median, so we let the range from $63K to $200K 2024 dollars represent our "middle".)</p>
   <p>The first lesson here is that <em>income tax policy has been least important for the middle-income group</em>. There's just a lot less variation at $63K, $100K, and $200K levels than at levels above and below.</p>

   </div> A second lesson, which was entirely new to me until Chris pointed it out, is that for low-income people, the crucial tax reform happened in 1970, under Richard Nixon! 
   <p><a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/file/182549/download?token=IeifAYsd">From 1944-1969</a> the standard deduction was defined as 10% of income to a maximum of $1000. That meant that, then and now, the standard deduction did very little for high-income earners. But before 1970, it also did very little for low-income earners. In 1970, the standard deduction became defined as a fixed amount, which meant that people with very low incomes could deduct everything. A fixed-amount standard deduction renders the effective income tax very progressive at low incomes, but its influence fades as incomes rise.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1962-1972.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1962-1972.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1962-1972"></a></p>
   <p>A third lesson is just how terrible JFK's tax cuts were, for those of us who believe that democracy and a decent society depend upon preventing plutocratic wealth accumulation. Between 1963 and 1965, effective tax rates paid by $100M earners dropped by 20 percentage point, while a middle-income earner making $100K (in 2024 dollars) saw relief of 4 to 5 percentage points.</p>
   <p>A fourth lesson is that the period 1965 to 1980 was a political economy catastrophe. There were no tax increases on ultra-high-income earners during the period, but ordinary high-income earners saw their tax burden steadily rise.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1965-1980.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1965-1980.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1965-1980"></a></p>
   <p>Ordinary high-income earners represent a very important group of people. They are most successful professionals, influential in society and much more numerous than ultra-high-income earners. This is the group that actually peoples the commanding heights of the economy and the media. Raising taxes on this group while holding plutocratic earners harmless was a terrible own goal. It delivered very little of the main benefit of progressive taxation (preventing plutocratic wealth accumulation!) while it sewed the seeds for a tax revolt.</p>
   <p>The tax policy of this period was not calibrated to win the hearts and minds of middle-income earners. Lower-middle-income earners did enjoy some tax relief, but upper-middle-income earners endured increases, the middle-middle was basically flat. I suspect the dumb policy was motivated fiscal revenue accounting. Increasing rates on high-income earners delivers revenue, while ultra-high-income earners avoided their much higher taxes by not realizing personal income.</p>
   <p>But financing the government is not about revenue in accounting terms. It depends on the disinflationary impulse that taxation provokes. Taxing high earners is less disinflationary, serves to finance spending less effectively, than taxing people lower in the income scale. Because affluent people's marginal dollar of income is usually saved rather than spent, taxing it does not reduce spending. So the additional revenue was largely fruitless. The additional resentment, however, made fertile ground from which a terrible flower would soon blossom.</p>
   <p><a href="https://x.com/interfluidity/status/1092519956439130112">Billionaire politics</a> is about making human shields of the merely affluent.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-1988.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-1988.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1980-1988"></a></p>
   <p>A fifth lesson is that Ronald Reagan's tax policy was horrendous, and is largely still with us today.</p>
   <p>Those high-income earners who had grown resentful of their tax burden, which had been steadily increasing since the mid-sixties? They finally got their, um, retribution. Ultra-high-income earners, who had suffered no increase at all, hitched a ride on this tax revolution by affluent professionals and won the biggest rate cuts of all.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile lower-middle-income earners saw their rates <em>rise</em> over the period. What the fuck was the matter with Kansas?</p>
   <p>George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton undid only about a quarter of the damage Reagan had done. Not to mention JFK.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-2000.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1980-2000.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1980-2000"></a></p>
   <p>And that is the world in which we continue to live. Post Y2K, rates fluctuate, but rates on ultra-high-income earners have basically been flat.</p>
   <p>Middle income rates rarely move much. But grading on a curve, cosidering the narrow range over which middle income rates do fluctuate, the tax cuts under George W. Bush and Trump did yield middle income tax relief. This relief has stuck, as only high and ulta-high income rates reverted under Obama, and nothing much has changed over Biden.</p>
   <p>While I'm sure it's true, in dollar terms, that the overwhelming majority of the 2017 tax cuts go to very high earners, Trump, unlike Ronald Reagan, did actually deliver at least a little to people at middle incomes.</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-2000-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-2000-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 2000-2024"></a></p>
   <p>(Low income effective rates have been flat at zero throught the period. If you are wondering where the $10K line is, it may be hidden by the x-axis.)</p>
   <p>Pulling back, the overarching story is simple:</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/06/03/the-us-federal-income-tax-in-pictures/income-tax-cross-sections-1945-2024.png" alt="Income tax cross-sections by income, 1945-2024"></a></p>
   <p>Since World War II, US Federal income tax rates have fallen at every level. At middle incomes, they've deflated only modestly. But under the Kennedy and Reagan administrations, rates on ultra-high-income earners were demolished, in acts of social vandalism that have yet to be undone.</p>
   <p>By throwing just a few small chicken bones to higher-income professionals and the middle class, mad occultists opened a portal to resurgent plutocracy. You can feel its dark wings thumping. We are <a href="https://x.com/">living</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">with</a> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/barre-seid-heartland-institute-hillsdale-college-gmu">the</a> <a href="https://secure.winred.com/trump-national-committee-jfc/lp-ads-guilty-verdict-google/">consequences</a>.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it's time we reseal the portal.</p>

   <p>David Austin Walsh <a href="https://x.com/Gurdur/status/1794781436471640276">expressed frustration</a> with how difficult he has found landing a tenure-track position as an academic historian. He implied being "white dude" was one source of disadvantage in his search.</p>
   <p>That is a sensitive claim. The requisite, almost <em>pro forma</em>, scandal ensued. Walsh offered <a href="https://x.com/DavidAstinWalsh/status/1795029033777787327">an apology</a>, emphasizing perceptively the real source of his problem. Good positions in academia have been made scarce, cannibalized by the temporary and contingent roles into which Walsh himself has been slotted. In a game of musical chairs, it is an analytical error to blame any advantage of other players (real, perceived, or misperceived) for the difficulty of finding a seat. The recriminations just amuse the people who take away the chairs.</p>
   <p>There is a kind of irony in scabs lamenting the decline of good union jobs, except that academics have flattered themselves to be something above and apart from mere labor. Academics are society's true meritocrats, each one a self-made hero. The neoliberalization of the academy was sealed when faculty reconceived themselves as market victors rather than a guild or, in the more modern term, a labor union. Assistant, associate, full, adjunct, post-doc, graduate instructor, these are just a lot of words to describe a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/08/30/how-two-tier-unions-turn-workers-against-each-other/">two-tier</a> <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-two-tier-union-contracts-became-labors-undoing/">labor</a> <a href="https://www.tdu.org/how_two_tier_contracts_hurt_workers_and_weaken_unions">contract</a>.</p>
   <p>("Scab" is too cruel a word to describe Walsh and all the other adjuncts and postdocs who are victims of a dissolution of worker power they collectively help to perpetuate but did not author. I don't know if anyone has invented an epithet for high-seniority workers who acquiesce to two-tier labor arrangements, but there ought to be a bitter one. It is a deeper form of betrayal, and typically made under less duress, than "scab".)</p>
   <p>Anyway, tempest met teapot. So of course Chris Rufo had to chime in. He <a href="https://x.com/DavidAstinWalsh/status/1795186440701120831">wrote to</a> Walsh:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>There is a redemption arc available to you: tell the truth about DEI and academic corruption. The answer is not to grovel harder — self-abasement is repellent to all factions — but to take a courageous stand against the institutions that have gone astray. Everyone knows that you would have easily earned a faculty position even ten years ago, but the powers that be are pushing through underqualified "race and gender scholars" in all of the humanities departments. Your professional path as the "white male ally" has reached the terminus. Why not tell the truth?</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I find this so amusing. I feel I just have to share.</p>
   <p>Our dear friend Chris Rufo seems to believe as a "truth about DEI and academic corruption" that attempts to increase diversity in academia have led to a decline in standards and faculty quality.</p>
   <p>Chris Rufo should know! He is no mere onlooker. Rufo is the great protagonist of the reconstruction of <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/02/27/new-college/index.html">my</a> <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/05/03/we-haunt/index.html">own</a> <em>alma mater</em>, <a href="https://www.ncf.edu/">New College of Florida</a>, which the gentleman is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/opinion/christopher-rufo-diversity-desantis-florida-university.html">restoring to its role</a> under "the classical liberal tradition...produc[ing] scholarship in pursuit of the true, the good and the beautiful."</p>
   <p>Chris Rufo would never try to tilt scales in hiring or recruitment in order to favor some crass ascriptive identity like race or gender.</p>
   <p>Oh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/opinion/columnists/gender-studies-ron-desantis-florida.html">wait</a>.</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Rather than reviving some traditional model of academic excellence, then, it looks as though New College leaders are simply trying to replace a culture they find politically hostile with one meant to be more congenial. The end of gender studies and the special treatment given to incoming athletes are part of the same project, masculinizing a place that had been heavily feminist, artsy and queer. When I spoke to Rufo last weekend, he offered several explanations for New College’s new emphasis on sports, including the classical idea that a healthy body sustains a healthy mind. But an important part of the investment in athletics, he said, is that it is a way to make New College more male and, by extension, less left wing.</p>
    <p>In the past, about two-thirds of New College’s students were women. "This is a wildly out-of-balance student population, and it caused all sorts of cultural problems,” said Rufo. Having so many more women than men, he said, turned New College into “what many have called a social justice ghetto." The new leadership, he said, is “rebalancing the ratio of students” in the hopes of ultimately achieving gender parity.</p>
    <p>But gender parity is not necessarily compatible with a pure academic meritocracy, which Rufo claims to prize.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Earlier in the piece, Michelle Goldberg points out...</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Rufo speaks a lot about academic excellence and the virtues of a classical liberal education. But as Steven Walker of The Sarasota Herald-Tribune <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/education/2023/07/27/new-college-of-florida-pursues-student-athletes-at-academic-cost-richard-corcoran/70445567007/">reported</a> in a damning July story, the incoming class recruited by the new administration has lower average grades, SAT scores and ACT scores than last year’s class. "Much of the drop in average scores can be attributed to incoming student-athletes who, despite scoring worse on average, have earned a disproportionate number of the school’s $10,000-per-year merit-based scholarships," wrote Walker.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>I think we all have to concede, Rufo has proven his point. Attempts to remake a college in crass demographic terms can indeed be "corrupt" in the sense of elevating those of "lesser merit" by someone's contestable criteria over people who would be "more deserving" under those measures. And, this kind of ideologically motivated social engineering can be deeply intertwined with <a href="https://www.wusf.org/education/2024-04-12/richard-corcoran-200k-bonus-new-college-of-florida">astonishing</a> <a href="https://ncfcatalyst.com/the-changing-image-of-new-college/">patronage</a> and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/629209-david-rancourt-joins-new-college-as-dean-of-students/">careerism</a>.</p>
   <p>Rufo and his movement seem particularly wedded to rehabilitating masculine virtues, which I unironically applaud. There is indeed a crisis that demands redress surrounding masculinity. Whether we like it or not, males are and will continue to be nearly half of the population. They, like every other minority, deserve to be integrated in all of our institutions. We should acknowledge that the mere fact college-student populations are disproportionately female may not reflect invidious discrimination. Differences in outcome may reflect real differences in aptitude, interest, or ability. But we should treat skeptically claims that groups which underperform today must always underperform due to something inherent in their natures. Sometimes these outcomes reflect systemic, even <em>structural</em>, inhospitabilties entrenched in the institutions where members of the group seem to underperform. If a better developed athletics program helps to make differently gendered students feel more at home at New College, then I am all for it.</p>
   <p>Along with that, I'd encourage embracing the positive aspects of masculinity. Ideals like courage, chivary, and self-reliance.</p>
   <p>A man, for example, when he openly picks a fight, he lands his blows but he accepts that a few blows might also land upon him. At least perhaps glancingly, if at all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WUjgjN7Ssw">upon his shoe</a>).</p>
   <p>A man fights his own battles. He does not <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1677411849468547072">womanishly call in some overweening authority</a>, in order to absolutely crush a much, much weaker enemy half his age, in a fight he himself initiated.</p>
   <p>A man expects resistence in battle. He accepts it, respects it, even when it is his mission to defeat it.</p>
   <p><a href="https://x.com/socialistlegacy/status/1690062620508803073">Magnanimity</a> under circumstances where you have completely won, where the full power and authority of the state is yours to command, might <em>not</em> subsist in needlessly driving a helpless and defeated enemy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2023/08/10/charges-dropped-against-new-college-student-accused-spitting-trustee/">from their home and community</a>.</p>
   <p>I wish the project of restoring masculine virtues much greater success than it has thus far enjoyed.</p>

   <p>Kevin Williams has written a <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/">very good piece</a> about the straight-up superiority of Chinese electric vehicles. When Americans try to understand China's success at industry, they used to think in terms of cheap labor. By now we've come to acknowledge agglomeration effects. China has developed rich "ecosystems", which render proficiencies supportive of their industries effortlessly abundant.</p>
   <p>What Williams' piece highlights is product design. Chinese EVs are just better, cooler, more desirable products than anything Western manufacturers have on offer. That cuts deep. As industry after industry has migrated, many Americans continue to nurse a conceit, encapsulated in Apple's mantra "Designed in California. Assembled in China."</p>
   <p><em>Okay,</em> we like to tell ourselves, <em>our comparative advantage is no longer in fabricating things, with belching smokestacks and fussy labor. Our comparative advantage is the <u>high value</u> part, the <u>creativity</u>. It's fine and sensible that we outsource all the rest.</em></p>
   <p>Among many trenchant observations, Williams' piece notes</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Xiaomi...a phone manufacturer...decided to design and manufacture its own car. Unlike Apple, Xiaomi actually pulled this off, and the end product is so advanced it’s made headlines all over the world.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Apple just can't do what Chinese firms can. As Dan Wang <a href="https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/">has emphasized</a>, production excellence inheres mostly in tacit forms of knowledge that develop only via rich and continuous feedback across every aspect of product development. Apple in California is isolated from processes that should inform and inspire it. Even Einstein would not have been Einstein had there been no physics community into which he could enmesh himself.</p>
   <p>The word "ecosystem" has become something of a commonplace. But as Maria Farrell <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2022/12/08/your-platform-is-not-an-ecosystem/">has pointed out</a>, what the hypemasters of tech call "ecosystems" are better described as plantations. An ecosystem is a chaotic, polycephalic beast. It is a site simultaneously, paradoxically, of competition and collaboration. It is owned or controlled or dominated by no single organism or species. It is an always changing but also self-stabilizing web of interdependence.</p>
   <p>The idea of an "Apple ecosystem" is a contradiction in terms. Apple cannot be an ecosystem. Apple is flailing because it is starved of one.</p>
   <p>The United States is finally trying to reverse its great decline into forms of specialization and trade that lobotomize us. I am very supportive of, and very grateful for, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act">CHIPS Act</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act">Bipartisam Infrastructure Law</a>. But, I fear that rather than developing ecosystems, our political system is more likely to support a few plantations.</p>
   <p>Among the most destructive scandals in recent US history was the kerfuffle over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra">Solyndra</a>. Solyndra was a solar cell startup, to which the Obama Administration <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/solyndra-breaks-ground-new-500mw-solar-panel-plant">guaranteed $535M in loans</a> in 2009. When, unexpectedly, Chinese producers <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices">knocked the floor</a> from beneath solar cell prices, Solyndra's process became uneconomic. The firm went bankrupt in 2011, and the Federal government had to eat a loss.</p>
   <p>The larger program that had funded Solyndra <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/11/13/363572151/after-solyndra-loss-u-s-energy-loan-program-turning-a-profit">did fine</a>, even turned a profit for the Federal government. Without that program, there would likely be no <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/12/29/loan-program-that-funded-solyndra-finds-success-in-tesla-and-many-others/">Tesla</a>. Nevertheless, the embarassment and scandal surrounding Solyndra has discouraged politicians from lending to smaller, less certain ventures ever since.</p>
   <p>We in the United States are counterproductively attached to very simple and immediate forms of state accountability. Every meeting should be open and transparent. Every dollar spent should have a responsible party to blame if, sometime later, we decide that it was spent foolishly or corruptly. An opposing political party and an adversarial press eagerly collude to characterize even the most justifiable choices as corrupt, if in the end they don't work out. It's hard to get people to take a lot of risks under these conditions.</p>
   <p>Subsidy in China is helpfully more diffuse. In addition to overt subsidy (especially on the demand side), China finds ways to subsidize industries without accountable bureaucrats directly cutting checks. The central government simply communicates, widely and forcefully, that it wants effort devoted to an industry. Local governments and state-owned banks do the rest of the work. Local governments collaborate with entrepreneurs to put together ventures. Banks, which are not insulated from politics as Western dogma prescribes, become interested in funding such ventures.</p>
   <p>From <a href="https://ucigcc.org/blog/how-solar-developed-from-the-bottom-up-in-china/">an account of China's solar industry</a> by Jonas Nahm:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The inclusion of solar PV on the list of strategic emerging industries in 2010 and the goals set in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015) for the solar industry greenlighted subnational government plans to support their local solar firms. As a result, China’s solar firms had access to large sums of capital through bank loans, provided by state-owned banks and frequently guaranteed by local government entities or state-owned companies.</p>
    <p>Credit lines to expand manufacturing capacity were brokered and backed by local governments and state-owned firms, even in the years after the global financial crisis when the collapse particularly of European markets led to overcapacity in global solar markets. Providing loans was a way to improve local GDP growth rates, employment rates, and other indicators of economic development used to determine cadre performance and promotions. Solar PV’s status, first as a designated high-technology sector, and, starting in 2010, as a strategic emerging industry in central government plans further encouraged local government officials and state-owned banks to continue lending to China’s solar PV sector.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>There does remain some market discipline. Entrepreneurs still put up their own capital. Banks still try to discriminate between better and worse ventures in targeted industries. The state subsidy takes the form of a coordinated bias in otherwise decentralized decision-making. China's historical success at growing industries through "big pushes" renders applications for finance in a favored domain genuinely superior to similar applications outside of one. A widely shared understanding that <em>this is what we are supposed to be doing</em> limits the downside risk to banks.</p>
   <p>Banks everywhere face soft budget constraints. Whether nonperforming loans must be written off, rendering a bank nakedly undercapitalized, or can be rolled forward is a regulatory choice, not a fact of nature. For banks, <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2039.html">accounting is destiny</a>. By treating banks whose lending decisions generally align with state priorities gently, the state subsidizes those banks without ever cutting checks beyond routine lending of reserves to institutions that are deemed to be well capitalized.</p>
   <p>Because local governments more than the central government take the lead in finding or putting together ventures, there are no national Solyndras. Local failures are more forgivable than central failures, from a public perspective. <em>Of course</em> it's the work of local governments to try to make sure our region takes part in the next big industry. Favoritism of central governments is divisive. The public imagines there were many enterprises to choose from, and the best connected got the gravy. But in a local context, the public understands there often simply would not be an enterprise absent tax breaks and loan guarantees. As every American locality that has shoveled out money for a stadium can attest, arguments for development can overmuscle concerns about corruption.</p>
   <p>In this model, there is still eventual accountability. Among the politically well-aligned banks, those who stand out from the pack as bad performers might be made examples of. No matter how cheap the loans, entrepreneurs still stand to lose invested capital. Local governments struggle if tax breaks are never met with offsetting development. Where holes are deepest, officials risk defenestration.</p>
   <p>The "artificial" enthusiasm created by this kind of loose, untitrated subsidy encourages too many entrants, from an orthodox financial perspective. It engenders "overcapacity", vicious price competition, and more eventual failures than would be typical in an "undistorted" business domain.</p>
   <p>But when all is said and done, "inefficient" exuberance is a better problem to have than failing to develop the ecosystems that nuture high-value industries. In a firm-by-firm tally, a lot of money will seem to have been "wasted". But if a competitive, world-class industry emerges, its value to the nation will far outstrip the cost of all the defaulted loans.</p>
   <p><a href="https://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.htm">Ricardo's difficult idea</a> is at best badly incomplete. National prosperity does not derive from merely exploiting comparative advantage, but from ensuring the comparative advantage you exploit is in the highest value industries.</p>
   <p>From national-security perspective, high-value industries reflect globally scarce capabilities. On-shoring them relieves risky dependencies on potentially adversarial powers, and develops a point of likely dependence among trading partners which, if necessary, can be <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/44/1/42/12237/Weaponized-Interdependence-How-Global-Economic">weaponized</a>.</p>
   <p>The fiscal costs of China's indirect subsidies are shrouded, but they are very real. They are buried in arcana on the balance sheets of underperforming banks. They hide in flows from the central to local governments that ensure garbage still gets collected despite tax shortfalls. In drips and increments, most of the costs of failures end up on the central government's balance sheet. But there will have been no scandal, no Solyndra. And, if a globally competitive ecosystem has been seeded, the increment to public debt will be overwhelmed by the industry's contribution to GDP.</p>
   <p>It is unlikely that the United States could adopt China's approach to subsidy directly. In the United States we are obsessively allergic to anything that looks like state corruption, even while we lionize the architects and beneficiaries of every form of private corruption. This set of values does not work to our advantage.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we can try to structure our subsidies to render them more diffuse. We could offer them through states and municipalities, rather than as direct Federal programs. We could offer cheap finance to <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/03/26/banks-should-fail-much-more-often/index.html">smaller, specialist banks</a> to fund ventures in targeted industries. We could precommit to tallying and evaluating loan guarantee programs in aggregate, telegraph early the expectation of failures, point to the venture capital industry as a model of failure-tolerant success.</p>
   <p>But unlike venture capital, we should expect and tolerate a moderate net loss across the whole portfolio. The goal is not to earn an investment profit, or to hide financial underperformance in positive-but-less-than-market returns we can pretend are still profit. The goal is to jumpstart decentralized, competitive ecosystems in high value, tradable sectors. Which is worth a fiscal cost.</p>
