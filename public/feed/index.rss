   <p>Sixteen years ago, I was amped for the election of Barack Obama. I was all-in.</p>
   <p>To say that I was disappointed by Obama's presidency is an <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2023/11/30/obama-was-the-most-destructive-political-figure-of-my-lifetime/index.html">understatement</a>. I think Barack Obama broke my country. We are not red states or blue states but the United States of America, he famously loved to say. We are one country, undivided.</p>
   <p>But what he proved by his administration's choices is that there are creditors whom the law protects but does not bind, and there are debtors whom the law binds but does not protect. Barack Obama's oratory was soaring, inspiring, progressive. But his governance was the <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288">very definition</a> of conservative. There was just nothing and nobody left to trust.</p>
   <p>When "even the liberals" follow Wilhoit's Law, the only thing left to fight over is who's the in-group. Donald Trump perceived that, and we've been fighting it out ever since.</p>
   <p>Today I find that I am all-in for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. And I am terrified.</p>
   <p>Like a true-believing Calvinist fearful his predestiny might not be among the elect, I find myself trawling for signs, signs, signs. Will Harris continue the Biden-Harris administration's excellent start at reigning in corporate power, supporting labor, challenging plutocracy, building a nation that prospers not because "merit" is excusive, but because there is a successful place for all of us? Will Harris support the version of "free enterprise" that I support, under which the least of us, with grit and a good idea, can compete to offer wonders to our neighbors, and prosper from the good we do for others, without being bought-out or or rolled-up or crushed by monied interests? Or will she take "free enterprise" to mean what the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce mean — that big business must be left to do what it wants, regardless of how extractive or predatory their actions "superficially" appear to be, because the market knows our interest better than we do, even as we are foreclosed, evicted, outsourced, overcharged, and penalized?</p>
   <p>No matter how devout is our dear Calvinist, God does not actually reveal in signs who is among the elect, or who is damned.</p>
   <p>I can find hopeful signs, like Harris' choice of Tim Walz as running mate. I can find awful signs, like <a href="https://x.com/EugenePuryear/status/1821347244655640811">this from Maryland governor Wes Moore</a>. Matt Stoller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/opinion/kamala-harris-google-antitrust.html">reads entrails</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
   <p>But there were no reliable signs that Joe Biden — the Senator from MBNA, a man whose approach to bankruptcy law had previously been the white-shoe version of loan-shark kneecapping — would govern as heir to LBJ and FDR. The fact is we cannot know.</p>
   <p>"Surrogate" Wes Moore can go on CNBC and paint a picture of Kamala Harris that inspires in CEOs the same emotion Taylor Swift conjures in a middle-school field hockey team. And that's fine. That's what he should do, if his goal is to help Harris win. Whatever a "surrogate" says, Harris herself has not made any promises.</p>
   <p>We might prefer a version of democracy in which candidates make clear statements about how they would govern, and the public makes an informed choice among those alternatives.</p>
   <p>That would require a very different political system.</p>
   <p>Our actual system requires a candidate for the Presidency to win roughly 50% of votes cast. Yet no candidate, under a glare of full transparency, with (implausible) complete foresight about how they would govern, could avoid alienating more than 50% of the electorate on at least one of the dozens of issues people care about.</p>
   <p>Candidates run on vibes and empty platitudes as much as they can for the same reason network television was bad in the 1980s — not because it is what "the public" actually wants, but because the less there is any real substance, the greater the share of a diverse and fractious population that can agree to embrace it. The trick is to entertain (on television) or to inspire (in politics) without actually touching on anything that might piss somebody off.</p>
   <p>When it is more important to please everybody just a little than to please anybody all that much, what you offer is sweet nothings. Or, if you go negative, condemnations of vague categories not so many people identify with — "extremist", "leftist", "elite", "MAGA", "illegal".</p>
   <p>We know where Kamala Harris stands on abortion rights, because restoring Roe is very broadly popular. We know where Donald Trump stands on immigration, because tighter restriction is very broadly popular.</p>
   <p>When Project 2025 seemed to tell us, in extraordinary and exhaustive detail, what Donald Trump might do, it revealed a lot that might not be so broadly popular. Trump promptly disavowed it. We really can know very little about what these people will actually do. When we know too much, it is because they have made a mistake.</p>
   <p>We do know Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVjraH4Ydxw">stands with unions</a>. She has made strong public promises. That's a big fucking deal! Unions are a wedge issue within a Democratic coalition that still includes a big-business donor class and the Clintonian technocrats who several decades ago worked to seal the coffin on the labor movement in order to appease Alan Greenspan.</p>
   <p>So why do we know Kamala Harris stands with unions? Because, thank goodness, the most important battleground states are Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where unions are strong and very broadly popular.</p>
   <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html">remarkable work</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp_6fvf3Lzw">Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter</a> is a bit more arcane. It derives from a broad, populist demand to reign in buttfuckery and abuse we all experience from businesses we detest but cannot escape. But antitrust litigation is less participatory, less accessible, than a strike at the plant. There's no mass constituency in Pennsylvania whose vote will depend on <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/">Matt Stoller's</a> endorsement. Public promises are unlikely to be made by the campaign. A new administration could sell us out. Absolutely.</p>
   <p>But we are not the only ones a new administration might sell out. Sometimes there is no way to know who is the diner and who is the food until the meal commences.</p>
   <p>A Calvinist cannot know whether he is predestined for salvation or damnation. The best he can do is to perform good works, to live a life consistent with election. Standing around and bargaining with God, looking for signs and objecting to bad ones, is perhaps not a life best lived.</p>
   <p>The <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">United States Supreme Court notwithstanding</a>, the US President is not God. And nothing in our politics is predestined. But a life well-lived still demands a leap of faith.</p>
   <p>I'm all-in for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. We can support the campaign, while we cheerfully express the values that are guiding us as we do. I believe the United States' economy will require, over time, a pretty wholesale restructuring — so that business is a level playing field any of us can contest, so that workers have great choices employers compete to sweeten, so that the most successful among us get rich enough to live lives of enviable luxury, but never so rich they are ever more than one person with one vote in the governance of our affairs.</p>

   <p>We are so accustomed to being betrayed.</p>
   <p>Throughout the Clinton years, and especially the Obama years, we thought we were voting for Franklin Roosevelt’s party. Instead we found ourselves governed by parodies of Ronald Reagan, except garishly prouder of their fancier degrees. The arc of history bent toward every sort of justice except economic justice.</p>
   <p>Joe Biden, to his magnificent credit, strived, even if he did not always succeed, to govern in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt. But his term and his time are ending.</p>
   <p>So we are naked again. Of course, next year we might just be governed by fascists. We must do all we possibly can to prevent that. But does that mean we must struggle to elect another cadre of arrogant professionals who will <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4792753-gavin-newsom-executive-homeless-encampments-supreme-court-ruling/">clear us from their streets when we have nowhere to go</a>, even while they righteously rail against the Supreme Court justices who grant them the tools to do so?</p>
   <p>Only if we make that a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
   <p>A lot of angst has gone into reading tea leaves about who Kamala Harris <em>really</em> is. She has friends and colleagues among the corporate elite! When as Vice President she liaised with wealthy businessmen and courted their support, the poor dears lamented the burden of sitting on the other side of Lina Khan’s FTC. Harris duly sympathized.</p>
   <p>Kamala Harris is not a cipher. She is a professional politician. Like all of us, she is a human being with her own passions and principles. At some margin, at some critical moments, those passions and principles may hold sway. But as a professional politician, her work is to build a coalition to get elected, then, once elected, to staff and manage a government that sustains and expands the coalition.</p>
   <p>In a primary process or multiparty election, much of our job would be to suss out various candidate’s predilections, all those passions and principles, and choose which person or party’s values would be most likely to align with our own.</p>
   <p>We are not in a primary process or multiparty election.</p>
   <p>If you are a person who believes that a second Trump term — now with a <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">roadmap to Executive impunity</a> from an illegitimate Supreme Court — would be too dangerous to countenance, then you are going to vote for Kamala Harris.</p>
   <p>So. Just like under Obama, they’ll take us for granted. We’ll just have to <em>fall in line</em>, right?</p>
   <p>No.</p>
   <p>Our job now is to engage in a different kind of politics. A professional politician will dance with the ones that brung ‘em. It’s our job now to be the ones that bring Kamala Harris.</p>
   <p>If Lina-Khan-hating “liberal” corporate lawyers are Harris’ pillars of support, and by those weak pillars she still ekes out a victory over Donald Trump, well, then she might well govern as Obama 2.0 (and render inevitable a Trump 2.0). If Harris perceives her victories as happening despite us — the Bernie-ites, the Warren-ites, the social democrats — then she will do her best to ignore us while she placates her real constituents.</p>
   <p>But if she perceives her victories as happening <em>because</em> of us, then she will work for us and lead our movement.</p>
   <p>As part of that, we will have to rely upon our surrogates to work in private on our behalf. Now is not the time to extract promises in public that might be electorally counterproductive. AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren have access to the candidate. Although it goes against the grain of some naive conceptualizations of democracy, real negotiations happen in private. Sometimes the best that we can do is follow the lead of the people in the room whom we trust.</p>
   <p>There is no point now in grousing or debating like we are contesting a fantasy primary. Kamala Harris has already won. She is the champion we have.</p>
   <p>The work now isn’t for her to win us. It is for us to win her.</p>

   <p>Suppose, <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/findings">completely hypothetically</a>, you ran a small RCT on UBI. (ht <a href="https://x.com/morganwarstler/status/1815479501427712049">Morgan Warstler</a>)</p>
   <p>Then there would be no meaningful</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>increase in labor demand (as a policy choice, or potentially as a direct effect of the UBI if demand is unmanaged) [to] restore[] the original quantity of work provided, but at significantly higher wages.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>(Fourth slide above.)</p>
   <p>So what you would expect is to be stuck at the second diagram reproduced above. You would see a some reduction of the quantity of labor supplied, rather than the desired effect of an unchanged quantity of labor supplied, but at somewhat higher wages (the third diagram).</p>
   <p>To the degree that a basic income <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/findings/entrepreneurship">increases</a> <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5066.html">entrepreneurial intentions</a>, that might also, by a completely separate mechanism, yield an immediate-term reduction in employment and income, while recipients reduce labor force participation to devote time to enterprises not yet paying off.</p>
   <p>Hypothetically speaking, a two percentage point difference in employment and 1.3 hour per week average reduction in work hours — with both effects often indistinguishable within a 90% confidence interval, probably always indistinguishable within a more conventional 95% confidence interval — might strike one as a surprisingly small effect for a $1000 per month basic income pilot.</p>
   <p>Which might be a shame! It would suggest only a modest wage increase if a genuinely universal basic income of that amount were enacted, assuming continued full-employment macro policy.</p>
   <p>But, at least directionally, it would suggest an increase in wages for a constant quantity of labor supplied.</p>
   <p>And recipients would enjoy the <em>per se</em> benefits of an extra $1000 a month, taken in some mix of cash and time for education, care, leisure, or entrepreneurship.</p>

   <p>It's a fraught time.</p>
   <p>Last night we endured a ranting lunatic allege that the nearly 80,000 alleged gang members El Salvador's President Bukele has detained without process have been dumped onto America's streets, contributing to a US crime wave that simply does not exist over the relevant time frame. (The crime wave that did exist <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/opinion-ted-cruzs-fearmongering-rnc-105151488.html">emerged only</a> during the ranting lunatic's presidency, years before, and has been subsiding ever since.)</p>
   <p>In the meantime, we still haven't settled on an alternative to the ranting lunatic that sane people might vote for.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, I'm stuck in a news cycle three-weeks old. Remember that one? The one that marked the <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">end of liberal democracy</a> in the United States by providing a road map for how a US President can wield the vast powers of the American state without He or His <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/05/if-the-issue-was-the-lawfare/index.html">suboordinates</a> facing any practical risk of accountability to the law?</p>
   <p>I mean, I know there has been a <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/the-changes-in-vibes-why-did-they-happen.html">vibe shift</a>. But I'm having a hard time letting go of the whole liberal democracy thing. I guess it's pretty cringe.</p>
   <p>Anyway, this piece won't be an essay. It will mostly be exceprts of the Supreme Court decision, concurrences, and dissents. I've discussed <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> a lot over the last few weeks, and I just want to keep some of the most prominent bits around to refer to.</p>
   <p>Before delving into the effluent from the Injustices of our Supreme Coup, I want to reproduce a sketch from Asha Rangappa. (Click for full size.)</p>
   <p><a class="bracketless" href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/19/trump-v-united-states-greatest-hits/asha-rangappa-flow-chart_1146x896.png"><img width="100%" src="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/19/trump-v-united-states-greatest-hits/asha-rangappa-flow-chart_1146x896.png" alt="Flowchart of determinations under Trump v. United States immunity tests"></a></p>
   <p>I think it's a very helpful summary. Please do read the <a href="https://asharangappa.substack.com/p/the-bloodless-coup-has-startedwith">excellent essay</a> from which I have stolen it. Rangappa writes:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>What you might notice if you follow the lines above carefully is that the question of motive — the reason that an action was taken — doesn’t even enter the equation until <em>after</em> the determination of whether the actions was official or unofficial has been made. Indeed, the Court explicitly states that <strong>"In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives."</strong></p>
    <p>This is an astonishing statement, because it effectively means that <strong>it does not matter if a President uses the official levers of power with corrupt intent, for personal gain, or as retribution.</strong> In other words, the Court engages a sleight of hand where a critical distinction between <em>lawful and unlawful conduct</em> — the heart of criminal law, which rests on whether a person acted with a specific state of mind, or <em>mens rea</em> — ceases to exist when it comes to the President.</p>
   </blockquote>

   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 4:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Citing <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), the [D.C. Circuit] court distinguished between two kinds of official acts: discretionary and ministerial. 91 F. 4th, at 1189–1190. It observed that “although discretionary acts are ‘only politically examinable,’ the judiciary has the power to hear cases” involving ministerial acts that an officer is directed to perform by the legislature. <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Marbury,</em> 1 Cranch, at 166). From this distinction, the D. C. Circuit concluded that the “separation of powers doctrine, as expounded in Marbury and its progeny, necessarily permits the Judiciary to oversee the federal criminal prosecution of a former President for his official acts because the fact of the prosecution means that the former President has allegedly acted in defiance of the Congress’s laws.” 91 F. 4th, at 1191. In the court’s view, the fact that Trump’s actions “allegedly violated generally applicable criminal laws” meant that those actions “were not properly within the scope of his lawful discretion.” <em>Id.</em>, at 1192. The D. C. Circuit thus concluded that Trump had “no structural immunity from the charges in the Indictment.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 7:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>No matter the context, the President’s authority to act necessarily "stem[s] either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself." <em>Youngstown,</em> 343 U. S., at 585. In the latter case, the President’s authority is sometimes "conclusive and preclusive." <em>Id.,</em> at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring). When the President exercises such authority, he may act even when the measures he takes are "incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress." <em>Id.,</em> at 637. The exclusive constitutional authority of the President "disabl[es] the Congress from acting upon the subject." <em>Id.,</em> at 637–638. And the courts have "no power to control [the President’s] discretion" when he acts pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution. Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 166.</p>
    <p>If the President claims authority to act but in fact exercises mere “individual will” and “authority without law,” the courts may say so. <em>Youngstown,</em> 343 U. S., at 655 (Jackson, J., concurring). In <em>Youngstown,</em> for instance, we held that President Truman exceeded his constitutional authority when he seized most of the Nation’s steel mills. See <em>id.,</em> at 582–589 (majority opinion). But once it is determined that the President acted within the scope of his exclusive authority, his discretion in exercising such authority cannot be subject to further judicial examination.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 8:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>“To the executive alone is intrusted the power of pardon,” and the “legislature cannot change the effect of such a pardon any more than the executive can change a law.” <em>Id.,</em> at 147–148. The President’s authority to pardon, in other words, is “conclusive and preclusive,” “disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.” <em>Youngstown,</em> 343 U. S., at 637–638 (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, pp. 8-9:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions on subjects within his “conclusive and preclusive” constitutional authority. It follows that an Act of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such Presidential actions. We thus conclude that the President is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 14:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>we conclude that the separation of powers principles explicated in our precedent necessitate at least a <em>presumptive</em> immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility. Such an immunity is required to safeguard the independence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution. Indeed, if presumptive protection for the President is necessary to enable the “effective discharge” of his powers when a prosecutor merely seeks evidence of his official papers and communications, <em>id.,</em> at 711, it is certainly necessary when the prosecutor seeks to charge, try, and imprison the President himself for his official actions. At a minimum, the President must therefore be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” <em>Fitzgerald,</em> 457 U. S., at 754.</p>
    <p>But as we explain below, the current stage of the proceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether this immunity is presumptive or absolute</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 17:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 17:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Nor may courts deem an action unofficial merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, pp. 20-21:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>the Executive Branch has “exclusive authority and absolute discretion” to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute, including with respect to allegations of election crime. <em>Nixon,</em> 418 U. S., at 693; see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, 599 U. S. 670, 678–679 (2023) (“Under Article II, the Executive Branch possesses authority to decide ‘how to prioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions against defendants who violate the law.’” (quoting <em>TransUnion LLC</em> v. <em>Ramirez</em>, 594 U. S. 413, 429 (2021))). The President may discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II, §3. And the Attorney General, as head of the Justice Department, acts as the President’s “chief law enforcement officer” who “provides vital assistance to [him] in the performance of [his] constitutional duty to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.’” <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, 472 U. S. 511, 520 (1985) (quoting Art. II, §1, cl. 8).</p>
    <p>Investigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking is “the special province of the Executive Branch,” <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Chaney</em>, 470 U. S. 821, 832 (1985), and the Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President, Art. II, §1. For that reason, Trump’s threatened removal of the Acting Attorney General likewise implicates “conclusive and preclusive” Presidential authority. As we have explained, the President’s power to remove “executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed” may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts. Myers, 272 U. S., at 106, 176; see supra, at 8. The President’s “management of the Executive Branch” requires him to have “unrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates”—such as the Attorney General—“in their most important duties.” <em>Fitzgerald,</em> 457 U. S., at 750 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>
    <p>The indictment’s allegations that the requested investigations were “sham[s]” or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. App. 186–187, Indictment ¶10(c). And the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority. Trump is therefore absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 31:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>If official conduct for which the President is immune may be scrutinized to help secure his conviction, even on charges that purport to be based only on his unofficial conduct, the “intended effect” of immunity would be defeated. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756. The President’s immune conduct would be subject to examination by a jury on the basis of generally applicable criminal laws. Use of evidence about such conduct, even when an indictment alleges only unofficial conduct, would thereby heighten the prospect that the President’s official decisionmaking will be distorted. See <em>Clinton,</em> 520 U. S., at 694, n. 19.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 37:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>We do not ordinarily decline to decide significant constitutional questions based on the Government’s promises of good faith. See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U. S. 460, 480 (2010) (“We would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promised to use it responsibly.”). Nor do we do so today.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 40:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The dissents’ positions in the end boil down to ignoring the Constitution’s separation of powers and the Court’s precedent and instead fear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals about a future where the President “feels empowered to violate federal criminal law.” <em>Post,</em> at 18 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.); see <em>post,</em> at 26, 29–30; <em>post,</em> at 8–9, 10, 12, 16, 20–21 (opinion of JACKSON, J.). The dissents overlook the more likely prospect of an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself, with each successive President free to prosecute his predecessors, yet unable to boldly and fearlessly carry out his duties for fear that he may be next.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From Opinion of the Court, <strong>John Roberts</strong>, p. 42:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit is vacated</p>

   <p><em>From <strong>Amy Coney Barrett</strong>, concurring in part, p. 6:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The Constitution does not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents can be held liable. Consider a bribery prosecution—a charge not at issue here but one that provides a useful example. The federal bribery statute forbids any public official to seek or accept a thing of value “for or because of any official act.” 18 U. S. C. §201(c). The Constitution, of course, does not authorize a President to seek or accept bribes, so the Government may prosecute him if he does so. See Art. II, §4 (listing “Bribery” as an impeachable offense); see also Memorandum from L. Silberman, Deputy Atty. Gen., to R. Burress, Office of the President, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems Arising Out of the President’s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller To Be Vice President Under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (suggesting that the federal bribery statute applies to the President). Yet excluding from trial any mention of the official act connected to the bribe would hamstring the prosecution. To make sense of charges alleging a <em>quid pro quo</em>, the jury must be allowed to hear about both the <em>quid</em> and the <em>quo</em>, even if the quo, standing alone, could not be a basis for the President’s criminal liability.</p>

   <p><em>From <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong>, dissenting, pp. 10-11:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>The majority purports to keep us in suspense as to whether this immunity is absolute or presumptive, but it quickly gives up the game. It explains that, “[a]t a minimum, the President must . . . be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’” <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added). No dangers, none at all. It is hard to imagine a criminal prosecution for a President’s official acts that would pose no dangers of intrusion on Presidential authority in the majority’s eyes.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <hr>
   <p><em>From <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong>, dissenting, p. 12:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>the majority’s dividing line between “official” and “unofficial” conduct narrows the conduct considered “unofficial” almost to a nullity. It says that whenever the President acts in a way that is “‘not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority,’” he is taking official action. <em>Ante,</em> at 17 (quoting <em>Blassingame</em> v. <em>Trump</em>, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC 2023)). It then goes a step further: “In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” <em>Ante,</em> at 18. It is one thing to say that motive is irrelevant to questions regarding the scope of civil liability, but it is quite another to make it irrelevant to questions regarding criminal liability. Under that rule, any use of official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt purpose indicated by objective evidence of the most corrupt motives and intent, remains official and immune. Under the majority’s test, if it can be called a test, the category of Presidential action that can be deemed “unofficial” is destined to be vanishingly small.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong>, dissenting, pp. 29-30:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Looking beyond the fate of this particular prosecution, the long-term consequences of today’s decision are stark. The Court effectively creates a law-free zone around the President, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the Founding. This new official-acts immunity now “lies about like a loaded weapon” for any President that wishes to place his own interests, his own political survival, or his own financial gain, above the interests of the Nation. <em>Korematsu</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 323 U. S. 214, 246 (1944) (Jackson, J., dissenting). The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.</p>
    <p>Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends. Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority’s message today.</p>

   <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, pp. 9-10:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Immunity can issue for Presidents under the majority’s model even for unquestionably and intentionally egregious criminal behavior. Regardless of the nature or the impact of the President’s criminal conduct, so long as he is committing crimes “pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution,” <em>ante</em>, at 7, or as needed “to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution,” <em>ante</em>, at 14, he is likely to be deemed immune from prosecution.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the majority’s model simply sets the criminal law to one side when it comes to crimes allegedly committed by the President. Before accountability can be sought or rendered, the Judiciary serves as a newfound special gatekeeper, charged not merely with interpreting the law but with policing whether it applies to the President <em>at all</em>. Also, under the new Presidential accountability model, the starting presumption is that the criminal law does <em>not</em> apply to Presidents, no matter how obviously illegal, harmful, or unacceptable a President’s official behavior might be. Regardless of all that, courts must now ensure that a former President is <em>not</em> held accountable for any criminal conduct he engages in while he is on duty, unless his conduct consists primarily (and perhaps solely) of unofficial acts.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, p. 10:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>To fully appreciate the oddity of making the criminal immunity determination turn on the character of the President’s responsibilities, consider what the majority says is one of the President’s “conclusive and preclusive” prerogatives: “ ‘[t]he President’s power to remove . . . those who wield executive power on his behalf.’ ” <em>Ante,</em> at 8 (quoting <em>Seila Law LLC</em> v. <em>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, 591 U. S. 197, 204 (2020)). While the President may have the authority to decide to remove the Attorney General, for example, the question here is whether the President has the option to remove the Attorney General by, say, poisoning him to death. Put another way, the issue here is not whether the President has exclusive removal power, but whether a generally applicable criminal law prohibiting murder can restrict how the President exercises that authority.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, p. 11:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>under the individual accountability model, an indicted former President can raise an affirmative defense just like any other criminal defendant. This means that the President remains answerable to the law, insofar as he must show that he was justified in committing a criminal act while in office under the given circumstances. In other words, while the President might indeed be privileged to commit a crime in the course of his official duties, any such privilege exists only when the People (acting either through their elected representatives or as members of a jury) determine that the former President’s conduct was in fact justified, notwithstanding the general criminal prohibition.</p>
    <p>Under the majority’s immunity regime, by contrast, the President can commit crimes in the course of his job even under circumstances <em>in which no one thinks he has any excuse</em>; the law simply does not apply to him. Unlike a defendant who invokes an affirmative defense and relies on a legal determination that there was a good reason for his otherwise unlawful conduct, a former President invoking immunity relies on the premise that he can do whatever he wants, however he wants, so long as he uses his “‘official power’” in doing so. <em>Ante,</em> at 19. In the former paradigm, the President remains subject to law; in the latter, he is above it.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, pp. 13-14:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>whatever additional power the majority’s new Presidential accountability model gives to the Presidency, it gives doubly to the Court itself, for the majority provides no meaningful guidance about how to apply this new paradigm or how to categorize a President’s conduct. For instance, its opinion lists some examples of the “core” constitutional powers with respect to which the President is now entitled to absolute immunity—a list that apparently includes the removal power, the power to recognize foreign nations, and the pardon power. <em>Ante,</em> at 6–9. However, the majority does not—and likely cannot—supply any useful or administrable definition of the scope of that “core.” For what it’s worth, the Constitution’s text is no help either; Article II does not contain a Core Powers Clause. So the actual metes and bounds of the “core” Presidential powers are really anyone’s guess.</p>
    <p>Nor does the majority explain how to consistently distinguish between official and unofficial acts. Quite the opposite, in fact. While acknowledging that this is a critical line that courts must draw in order for its new accountability model to work properly, the majority simultaneously cautions that making this distinction “can be difficult”—likely a gross understatement given the recognized “breadth of the President’s ‘discretionary responsibilities’ under the Constitution and laws of the United States.” <em>Ante,</em> at 17.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p><em>From <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, dissenting, p. 15:</em></p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>while Congress (the branch of our Government most accountable to the People) is the entity our Constitution tasks with deciding, as a general matter, what conduct is on or off limits, the Court has now arrogated that power unto itself when that question pertains to the President. In essence, the Court has now imposed its own preclearance requirement on the application of Congress’s laws to a former President alleged to have committed crimes while in office. Who will be responsible for drawing the crucial “‘line between [the President’s] personal and official affairs’”? <em>Ante,</em> at 29. To ask the question is to know the answer. A majority of this Court, applying an indeterminate test, will pick and choose which laws apply to which Presidents, by labeling his various allegedly criminal acts as “core,” “official,” or “manifestly or palpably” beyond the President’s authority.</p>

   <p>An apology for the <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-enabling-act">Enabling Act</a> that the Supreme Court has <a href="https://drafts.interfluidity.com/2024/07/03/no-longer-a-liberal-democracy/index.html">judicially inserted into American law</a> goes like this:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>By prosecuting a former President, Democrats opened a Pandora's Box under which every ex-President would be prosecuted by their rivals upon retirement, crippling the office, and discouraging high-quality candidates from seeking it. The Supreme Court had to prevent this.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Let's say this was your honest concern, and you are John Roberts.</p>
   <p>You are not trying to render the Executive unaccountable. You want accountability, but some form of accountability that would deter routine political show trials of each party's highest-profile figure, prosecuted by the opposing party.</p>
   <p>That might be a reasonable goal.</p>
   <p>But if it really was your goal to deter "lawfare" while keeping the Executive Branch lawful, the decision you craft would look nothing like <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>.</p>
   <p>Sure, you might grant pretty broad immunity to the President, as this decision does.</p>
   <p>But you would not grant impenetrable deference to the President's pardon power. You would <em>encourage</em>, rather than prohibit, judicial inquiry into the motivation for pardons. Pardons for crimes ordered or encouraged or intended to serve the interest of the President would be invalid.</p>
   <p>The President would still be immune. His <em>subordinates</em>, however, would not be. His suboordinates would still have reason to refuse unlawful orders. At the very least, they would demand legal cover before following deeply questionable commands. (Just as <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/2014-06-23_barron-memorandum.pdf">Obama did</a>, before icing a US citizen in a drone strike.)</p>
   <p>This is the accountabilty equilibrium we created after the Nixon Administration. Yes, Ford pardoned Nixon. Nixon got to live the rest of his days as a free man, even an <em>eminence grise</em>.</p>
   <p>But many of his subordinates were imprisoned — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Haldeman">H. R. Haldeman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman">John Ehrlichman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Colson">Charles Colson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_N._Mitchell">John Mitchell</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Gordon_Liddy">G. Gordon Liddy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._McCord_Jr.">James W. McCord Jr.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dean">John Dean</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Chapin">Dwight Chapin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_W._Kalmbach">Herbert Kalmbach</a>.</p>
   <p>Had <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> been the law in 1972, all of these men could have been peremptorily pardoned. No judicial inquiry could have been made into the motivations for those pardons. No criminal liability could attach to the President for making them. No subpeonas could penetrate a hermetic wall of silence, since any contempt charges could be pardoned as well.</p>
   <p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> doesn't just grant the President immunity. It takes the heavily litigated notion of "executive privilege", renders it unjudiciable, and extends it as far and wide as the President wishes to extend it — with no remedy, no consideration of other interests, no hope ever of piercing it.</p>
   <p>In its own words, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> is about encouraging "bold", "unhesitating", "energetic", "vigorous" action by the President. John Roberts could have sought to balance the public's interest in an effective Executive with the public's interest that the President "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed". He could have whispered into the Constitution the post-Richard-Nixon balance. He chose not to.</p>
   <p>John Roberts and his henchmen are very familiar with this history. What they instead chose to whisper into the Constitution was a <em>remedy</em> for the accountability that the Nixon administration faced. They chose quite deliberately not merely to immunize the President, but to create an unaccountable Executive, whose breadth is as wide and encompassing as the President chooses by exercise of his power to pardon.</p>
