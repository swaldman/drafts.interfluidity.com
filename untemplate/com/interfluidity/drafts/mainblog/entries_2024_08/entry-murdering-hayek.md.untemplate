Price regulation is [in the ether](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-price-gouging-ban-inflation-65dc8844bb41159d76886f752b6cab28).
I find the "debate", such as it is, stupid. It seems obvious to me that some forms of price regulation, under some circumstances,
can be
[helpful](https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9416.html) or even
[necessary](https://jwmason.org/slackwire/in-praise-of-profiteering/).
Badly crafted or misapplied price regulation can indeed lead to gluts, shortage, mangled incentives, and destructive allocations.
It really does depend.

If you already know whether you like a "ban on price gouging" without having seen the details of the proposal,
you are just an ideologue, one way or the other. If you hold yourself out as an economist and you are taking a strong position
on Kamala Harris' proposal at its current level of unspecificity, might I recommend my recent piece on
[authority minimization](##authority-minimization)?

Rather than get ahead of ourselves, let's discuss a form of price reform that
is occurring already, without any impetus by the state. _The American Prospect_ recently did a
[full, remarkable issue](https://prospect.org/pricing) on pricing, emphasizing price discrimination
or "personalized pricing".

I find it a bit counterintuitive that it's my friends at _The American Prospect_ who get upset about this,
rather than my friends at George Mason University. (With genuine affection, I consider GMU Economics to be
the lightbearer for Hayekian economics, now that the man himself has left us.)

A common apology for
[first degree price discrimination](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-are-different-types-price-discrimination-and-how-are-they-used.asp)
is that it's "efficient". And it is, in one narrow sense.
Let's review the Econ-101-style diagrams below (modified from an [old piece](https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5117.html)):

<a class="bracketless" href="##./murdering-hayek-pricing-diagrams.png"><img style="width: 100%" src="##./murdering-hayek-pricing-diagrams.png"></a>

The upper-left-hand diagram shows the Marshallian equilibrium that we ordinarily imagine as efficient.
When the price &mdash; there is just one price, the same public price for everyone &mdash; has [groped](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tatonnement)
to where the supply and demand curves meet, both the quantity exchanged and total surplus is maximized.

The bottom row shows two pathological cases.
If the price is prevented from finding the equilibrium price &mdash; whether by private market power or
by public regulation &mdash; there is "deadweight loss" (the red triangles). Total surplus is reduced.

Surplus is a [problematic welfare measure](https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5149.html), but Econ 101 courses disgracefully
treat the two as interchangeable, so the smarty-pants pundit class does the same. Under this analysis, price-setting,
whether by states or by monopolies, makes the collective "us" _prima facie_ worse off.

The diagram on the upper right depicts "perfect" or "first degree" price discrimination. That's
when sellers know precisely the maximum amount each potential customer would be willing to pay for an item,
and charges precisely that. No real-life seller can know preferences so personally, but digital
tools now surveil, study, cluster, and then predict our behavior pretty well. In an app, on a website,
even [in a grocery store](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/17/nx-s1-5009271/electronic-shelf-labels-prices-walmart-grocery-store),
pricing can increasingly be tailored to us.

Notice that in this diagram there are no scary red triangles, there is no deadweight
loss. The quantity exchanged and the total surplus are the same as at the Marshallian equilibrium. So it's "efficient".

The only difference is distributional: In the single-price, Marshallian case, consumers and producers split the
surplus. In the price-discrimination case, producers enjoy all the surplus, and consumers enjoy none.
The purchases are "worth it" to buyers, but just. Whatever consumers have bought is worth no more to them than the
dollars they have lost (modulo perhaps some small epsilon to motivate the exchange). The sellers, on the other hand,
receive a lot more money than it cost to market the good.

To a certain kind of ecomomist, distribution doesn't matter, is a second-order concern at best. That is
far from my own view. People "on the left" tend to dislike price discrimination, because 
producer surplus (business profit) tends to go to the already wealthy, concentrating the distribution of
income and wealth, while consumer surplus gets more broadly distributed.

If you are Hayekian, you should have a different but equally fatal concern. From
[_The Use of Knowledge in Society_](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html):

(Emphasis mine.)

Let's consider a concrete case. I need a new roof, which could be made of tin or plastic. I prefer tin.
I'd be willing to pay up to $9000 for a tin roof and $5000 for a plastic roof. A price discriminating
monopolist offers me precisely those prices. Which I choose is then a flip of the coin. I've been deprived
of information that might distinguish them. At these prices, I'm indifferent between the two options, or
even to not buying at all.

Suppose that under a competitive single-price equilibrium, the tin roof would have cost $6000, and the plastic roof would
have cost $1000. Because tin is dear relative to my own knowledge of my preferences (my surplus for tin would be $3000,
for plastic $4000), I would have economized and purchased plastic, contributing to an efficient allocation.
But under perfect price discrimination, my contribution to as-if "single mind possessing all the information" is
reduced to noise, a fifty-fifty coin flip.

_Ah!_ you say, _But the price discriminating seller wouldn't behave this way!_ Megacorp would know the "true" prices
of underlying commodities, and would profit more from offering the plastic roof for $4900. At this price, I reliably
choose plastic, the seller makes $3900 rather than the mere $3000 it would have made from tin, and tin is economized
as it would be in a competitive market.

But then what you are saying is Megacorp's knowledge is sufficient to completely cut me out of the information
aggregation process with no loss. My local information has no role to play. Megacorp knows me well enough to prejudge
me and perform my role.

And maybe so! I don't know very much.

But it's turtles all the way down. If cartel and price discrimination are
normalized, then Megacorp's vendors are also predicting what Megacorp will pay, and providing prices that maximize
its own profits rather than reflect underlying social costs. Megacorp is also cut out of any role in the information
problem. The system ultimately works &mdash; correctly solves the market optimization problem &mdash; only if there is
some foundational set of vendors, a cartel for whom Hayek's "dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory
knowledge" have been surveilled and aggregated and reconciled after all.

Long ago I [tweeted](https://x.com/interfluidity/status/908391949350051840)

> path to socialism: Amazon solves economic calculation problem and swallows the whole economy. then we nationalize it.

If you think an economy in which price discrimination is normalized can be efficient, then you think Hayek's work is
obsolete. The cartel that price discriminates constitutes a capable central planner. If we will have a capable central
planner, most of us would have it under the control of an imperfectly democratic state, rather than operate as a maximizer
of private shareholders' wealth.

I do not in fact think Hayek is obsolete. Neither Amazon nor ChatGPT can solve economic calculation,
can account for the everchanging, infintely dispersed knowledge that drove Hayek's vision.

But if Hayek is not obsolete, if we move towards "personalized pricing", firms will routinely price
discriminate but misjudge. On the one hand, that means at least sometime consumers will still enjoy surplus. Hooray!

At the systemic level, however, it means our optimizer will be badly broken, and we will all be made the poorer.
Megacorp will think I'd be willing to pay $6000
for a plastic roof, and so offer it to me for $5900. But for that price, I prefer the tin. A social resource will have been
diverted from a high-value to a low-value use, because our price-discriminating planner erred. Multiply this kind of mistake
countless times through the economy, and Hayek's “economic calculus” goes haywire. We will have destroyed the very purpose
and function of markets in our economy.

Perhaps price discrimination can be perfected, and we should move to a centrally planned
economy. Or it cannot be, so Hayek remains right, and we should insist
on competitive markets with single public prices.
Which is it?

"I have deliberately used the word 'marvel' to shock the reader out of the complacency with which we often take the working of this mechanism for granted,"
Hayek [writes](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html) of the price system.

I find it astonishing how untroubled
Hayek's successors now seem by developments that could only be wise if that marvel has become a museum piece.

Maybe AI really will do a better job of allocating scarce resources than markets and the price system used to. Maybe it really is
time to move on.

But you'd think Hayekians would be evaluating that claim skeptically, rather than cheerleading the change.
